        <p>
        Bourbon is a spirit renowned for its rich, full-bodied sweetness, often showcasing notes of caramel, vanilla, and a gentle spice from the barrel aging.

        Bourbon's warmth and depth make it ideal for sipping neat or on the rocks, but it's also the base for iconic cocktails like the Old Fashioned, Mint Julep, or a classic Manhattan, where its smooth, sweet character shines through.

Bourbon, deeply entwined with American history, originates from the southern United States, particularly Kentucky, where it's celebrated for its unique production method and flavor profile. 

Unlike [rye](/recipes/spirit/rye/), bourbon requires a mash bill with at least 51% corn, which imparts its characteristic sweetness. 

This corn-centric mix, combined with a distillation process that must occur in the U.S., aging in new, charred oak barrels, and specific regulations like not exceeding 160 proof during entry into barrels, defines what bourbon is.

This spirit, embodying American craftsmanship, continues to captivate palates worldwide, each bottle telling a story of tradition, innovation, and the art of distillation.
