        <p>The drink starts with a rich, intense espresso base, providing deep, roasted coffee notes that are balanced by the smoothness of vodka. A hint of sweetness from coffee liqueur like Kahlua adds a subtle caramel flavor, while the vodka cuts through with a clean, crisp finish. Together, these ingredients create a creamy, velvety texture with just the right amount of bitterness and sweetness. The frothy top and espresso aroma make this cocktail both invigorating and luxurious.
