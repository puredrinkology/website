description: "The Red Snapper is a fruity, sweet cocktail belonging to the Sour family.  It's a modern invention, likely originating in the late 20th century, combining the sweet, nutty notes of Amaretto with the tartness of cranberry juice and the smooth character of Crown Royal whiskey. "
flavor_description: "The Red Snapper offers a sweet and tart experience.  The smooth, slightly vanilla-infused sweetness of Crown Royal blends perfectly with the almondy richness of Amaretto.  A vibrant tartness from cranberry juice cuts through the sweetness, creating a refreshing and balanced cocktail.  The overall taste profile is reminiscent of a festive holiday drink, but with a sophisticated twist. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Red Snapper, start by chilling your glass and ingredients. Use a good quality cranberry juice for a brighter flavor. When shaking, use a firm grip to ensure proper dilution. Don't over-shake; aim for a light, frothy texture. Garnish with a lime wedge or a Luxardo cherry for a vibrant touch. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing a Red Snapper Cocktail:Imagine a tall glass, frosted with condensation, filled with a vibrant, ruby-red liquid. It's a symphony of colors, with the deep crimson of cranberry juice dominating, punctuated by streaks of amber from the Crown Royal whiskey and a subtle hint of golden-brown from the Amaretto.  The drink is garnished with a single, glistening cranberry, its dark red hue contrasting beautifully with the bright red of the cocktail. Perhaps a small sprig of rosemary adds a touch of greenery, or a twist of orange peel graces the rim, adding a subtle citrus aroma to the mix. The ice cubes, perfectly clear and pristine, chime softly as they jostle in the glass, inviting you to take a sip.  The overall effect is one of festive cheer and delicious anticipation. "
