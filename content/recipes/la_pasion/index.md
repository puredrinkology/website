description: "La Pasion belongs to the **Highball** family, a refreshing category often featuring spirits, mixers, and ice. This contemporary creation likely originated in a modern bar, combining the smoky intensity of mezcal with the vibrant fruitiness of passionfruit, ancho reyes, and lime, all balanced by the crispness of soda water. "
flavor_description: "La Pasion is a vibrant and complex cocktail. The passionfruit syrup brings a sweet, tangy, and tropical fruitiness, while the mezcal adds a smoky and earthy note. Ancho Reyes, a chile liqueur, introduces a subtle spice and warmth. Lime juice provides acidity and freshness, and soda water adds a light and bubbly texture. The result is a well-balanced cocktail that is both refreshing and intriguing. "
