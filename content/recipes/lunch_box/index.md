fullname: "The Lunch Box Beer"
shortname: "Lunch Box"
description: "The Lunch Box is a unique blend from the **Highball** family, a group of cocktails typically served tall with ice. Its origin remains obscure, likely a modern invention combining the sweet, nutty notes of Amaretto with the refreshing tang of orange juice and a crisp beer base. "
flavor_description: "The Lunch Box offers a playful contrast of flavors. The beer's malt sweetness and subtle bitterness intertwine with the Amaretto's almond-laced sweetness. A touch of orange juice brightens the palate, adding a citrusy zing that cuts through the richness. The result is a well-balanced cocktail that's both refreshing and easy-drinking, perfect for a casual lunch or afternoon gathering. "
bartender_tips: "Start with a chilled glass to keep the drink cool. Pour the Amaretto first, then the beer (use a good quality lager or pale ale). Finish with the orange juice, layering it gently on top. Don't stir, as you want the flavors to remain separate. Garnish with an orange slice or wheel. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing the Lunch Box Cocktail:Imagine a **Lunch Box** cocktail. It's made with **beer, amaretto, and orange juice**.  **Describe the appearance of this drink in detail, using vivid imagery and sensory details. Consider:*** **Color:** What is the overall color of the drink? Is it clear, cloudy, layered, or a specific shade?* **Texture:** Is it smooth, bubbly, or foamy? * **Presentation:** Is it served in a tall glass, a short glass, with a garnish?  * **Light:** How does the light interact with the drink? Does it shimmer, reflect, or create interesting shadows? * **Smell:**  What aromas are present? Is it sweet, citrusy, boozy? **Example:**  The Lunch Box is a symphony of color in a tall glass. The bottom layer, a vibrant amber from the amaretto, shimmers beneath a frothy white head of beer.  A bright orange hue, courtesy of the juice, cuts through the center, creating a layered effect that reminds one of a sunset. The aroma is a delightful mix of sweet almond, crisp citrus, and a hint of malty beer. "
