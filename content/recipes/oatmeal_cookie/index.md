description: "The Oatmeal Cookie cocktail, a blend of Kahlua, Baileys, Butterscotch Schnapps, Jägermeister, and Goldschlager, belongs to the dessert cocktail family, a category known for its sweet, rich, and often creamy flavors.  This particular creation likely originated in the late 20th century, as it utilizes popular liqueurs of that era. "
flavor_description: "The Oatmeal Cookie is a decadent, dessert-like cocktail. It's a symphony of rich flavors: the coffee notes of Kahlua mingle with the creamy sweetness of Baileys and Butterscotch Schnapps, while a hint of spice from Jagermeister and the warm cinnamon of Goldschlager adds complexity. Expect a smooth, full-bodied experience, finishing with a lingering sweetness that evokes a freshly baked oatmeal cookie. "
bartender_tips: "Start by chilling all ingredients for a smoother, colder drink.  Measure carefully – this cocktail is about balance, not strength.  Layer the ingredients in the order listed, creating a beautiful visual.  Shake well with ice, but don't over-shake to avoid excessive dilution.  Strain into a chilled coupe glass.  Garnish with a chocolate shavings or a mini cookie for a playful touch. "
