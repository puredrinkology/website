description: "The Tequila Fizz is a member of the Fizz family, known for their lively carbonation and citrusy profiles.  Born in the early 20th century, this tequila-based iteration likely emerged in the American Southwest, combining the spirit's popularity with the Fizz's existing structure. "
flavor_description: "The Tequila Fizz is a vibrant and complex cocktail. The tequila provides a robust agave base, while the lemon juice adds a sharp, citrusy tang. Grenadine lends a sweet, fruity note, and the egg white creates a creamy, frothy texture.  Ginger ale offers a refreshing effervescence and subtle spice, balancing the sweet and tart elements for a delightful, well-rounded experience. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Tequila Fizz,  dry shake the tequila, lemon juice, and egg white vigorously for 20 seconds to emulsify the egg white.  Then, add ice and shake again. This creates a smooth, frothy top.  Finally, strain into a chilled glass and top with ginger ale for a refreshing fizz. "
