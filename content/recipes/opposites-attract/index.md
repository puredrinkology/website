bartender_tips: 'Muddle mint gently to release oils, not pulverize it.  Use a good
  quality Irish whiskey for a smoother base.  Ancho Reyes adds spice, so adjust to
  taste, starting with a dash.  Shake well with ice to chill and dilute, then strain
  for a refreshing finish.  Garnish with a lime wedge and sprig of mint, and enjoy! '

  the following details:*** **Color:** The drink is a vibrant, almost emerald green,
  but with hints of amber warmth peeking through from the whiskey.* **Texture:** The
  drink has a layered appearance, with a thin, foamy layer of mint-infused foam crowning

  amber hues.* **Garnish:** A sprig of fresh mint, its vibrant green leaves contrasting
  against the dark green of the drink, sits perched on the edge of the glass. A single,
  perfectly sliced lime wedge adds a touch of zesty brightness.* **Glassware:** The
  drink is served in a tall, elegant coupe glass, the curvature of the glass showcasing
  the layered depths of the drink.* **Overall Impression:** The cocktail exudes a
