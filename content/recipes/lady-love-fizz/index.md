bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Lady Love Fizz, the key is a smooth, frothy texture.
  Dry shake the gin, cream, sugar, lemon, and egg white vigorously for 30 seconds
  to emulsify the egg white. Then, add ice and shake again for 15 seconds. Double
  strain to remove any ice shards. Top with carbonated water for a delightful fizz. '
