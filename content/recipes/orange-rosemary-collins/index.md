bartender_tips: 'Muddle rosemary with a splash of gin to release its aroma.  Freshly
  squeeze your juices for vibrant flavor. Use simple syrup instead of rosemary syrup
  for a more subtle flavor.  Gently stir and top with soda water to maintain the beautiful
  layers. Garnish with a rosemary sprig and orange peel, expressing the oils over
  the drink before placing it. '

flavor_description: 'This cocktail bursts with bright, citrusy flavors from the orange
  and lemon juices, balanced by the earthy, slightly piney notes of rosemary. The
  gin adds a crisp, juniper backbone, while the soda water provides refreshing effervescence.
  The rosemary syrup adds a touch of sweetness and complexity, while the garnish of
  rosemary and orange peel enhance the aromatic experience.  It''s a light and refreshing
  cocktail perfect for warm days. '
