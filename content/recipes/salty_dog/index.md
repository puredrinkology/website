description: "The Salty Dog belongs to the **Highball** family, known for their tall, refreshing nature.  It hails from the 1930s, likely originating in the United States, where gin was gaining popularity and grapefruit juice was a newly-fashionable ingredient.  The salt rim, a touch of sophistication, elevates the classic citrus-gin combination. "
flavor_description: "The Salty Dog is a refreshingly tart and citrusy cocktail.  The grapefruit juice dominates, offering a bright, slightly bitter punch, balanced by the juniper notes and dryness of the gin. A subtle salty rim adds a savory complexity, enhancing the overall flavor and leaving a lingering, slightly saline finish. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Salty Dog, use fresh grapefruit juice - the tartness is key. A good quality gin is essential.  Rim the glass with coarse salt *before* adding ice, to prevent it from dissolving.  Shake the gin and juice with ice, then strain into the glass, ensuring the rim is salted.  Garnish with a grapefruit wedge for an extra burst of flavor. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: **Describe the appearance of a Salty Dog cocktail, focusing on its color, clarity, and any garnishes.** **Consider these factors:*** **Grapefruit juice:** This is the dominant flavor and color of the drink.  Is the juice fresh-squeezed, giving it a vibrant, slightly cloudy appearance, or is it commercially bottled, resulting in a more clear hue?* **Gin:** Gin is clear and colorless, so its effect on the drink's appearance is minimal. * **Salt:**  Salt is not visible in the drink, but it adds a subtle rim of salt on the glass, which should be mentioned.* **Garnish:**  A traditional garnish for a Salty Dog is a grapefruit slice or wedge. Describe its color and how it interacts with the drink's color. **Example output:**The Salty Dog is a vibrant, refreshing drink with a bright pink hue. The grapefruit juice, depending on its source, may appear slightly cloudy or perfectly clear. A thin rim of salt on the glass adds a touch of texture and complements the citrusy flavors. The drink is often garnished with a fresh grapefruit slice, its pink flesh contrasting beautifully with the bright liquid. "
