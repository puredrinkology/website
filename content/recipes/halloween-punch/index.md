bartender_tips: 'To make your Halloween Punch a hit, use fresh ginger and orange peel
  for the best flavor.  Muddle the ginger and cloves gently to release their essence,
  but avoid pulverizing them.  A few chili flakes add a subtle kick, but be careful
  not to overdo it.  Chill your vodka beforehand, as it''ll keep the punch icy cold
  and refreshing.  Strain the punch after infusing to avoid any stray chili flakes
  or ginger bits in your drink.  Enjoy! '

description: 'This Halloween Punch is a spiced, fruit-forward cocktail, akin to a
  spiced sangria. It draws inspiration from the centuries-old tradition of using spices
  and fruit in warming winter drinks, but with a modern twist using vodka for a chillingly
  smooth finish. '
