title: "Tequila Surprise"
description: "The Tequila Surprise belongs to the spicy cocktail family, a category with roots in the early 20th century. Its origin is likely rooted in the American Southwest, where the combination of tequila and fiery flavors was a popular choice. "
flavor_description: "The Tequila Surprise packs a fiery punch! The tequila's agave sweetness is immediately met with a bold, savory heat from the Tabasco.  Expect a lingering spice that warms the throat, balanced by the tequila's subtle herbal notes. It's a playful cocktail, ideal for those who enjoy a little kick and a surprise. "
bartender_tips: "This cocktail is all about balance.  A little Tabasco goes a long way! Start with a single drop and taste. Add more if you like, but keep it subtle.  Use a good quality tequila for a better flavor profile.  A good garnish, like a lime wedge or a jalape√±o slice, can enhance the taste and add a visual appeal.  Remember, this is a spicy cocktail, so enjoy it slowly. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of Tequila Surprise**Context:**Tequila Surprise is a cocktail made with tequila and Tabasco sauce. **Prompt:**Imagine a cocktail glass filled with a golden liquid, reminiscent of aged tequila, but with a subtle hint of fiery red along the edges.  The drink itself is clear, allowing you to see through it to the bottom of the glass, but the faint reddish hue gives it a sense of depth and intrigue.  As you gaze at it, you notice tiny droplets of oil from the Tabasco sauce clinging to the side of the glass, shimmering like tiny, fiery rubies.  What else do you see in this Tequila Surprise? Describe its appearance in detail, focusing on color, texture, and any other visual elements that contribute to its unique character. "
