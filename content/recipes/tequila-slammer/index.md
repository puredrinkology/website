visual: '## LLM Prompt:Imagine a tall glass filled with sparkling, crystal-clear **7-Up**,
  the bubbles dancing and reflecting the light.  At the bottom, a layer of **golden
  tequila** rests, its amber hue contrasting beautifully with the fizzy soda above.  The
  line between the two liquids is crisp and defined, like a miniature sunset, with
  a hint of lime green at the interface.  The entire drink is crowned with a delicate,
  frosted rim, promising a refreshing chill.  The **Tequila Slammer** is both simple
  and visually striking, its vibrant colors and refreshing appearance inviting you
  to take a sip. '
