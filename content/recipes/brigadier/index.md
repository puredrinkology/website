fullname: "The Brigadier Cocktail"
shortname: "Brigadier"
description: "The Brigadier, a unique blend of hot chocolate, Green Chartreuse, and Cherry Heering, defies easy categorization. It's likely a modern invention, drawing inspiration from the warm, comforting flavors of traditional hot chocolate and the herbal, bittersweet notes of Chartreuse. "
flavor_description: "The Brigadier is a rich and complex cocktail. The sweetness of hot chocolate is balanced by the herbal bitterness of Green Chartreuse and the cherry liqueur adds a fruity, slightly tart note. Expect a warm, comforting experience with a hint of spice and a lingering herbal finish. The combination is both familiar and surprising, making it a delicious and intriguing drink. "
bartender_tips: "Ensure the hot chocolate is rich and velvety, not watery.  Use a good quality dark chocolate for the best flavor.  Don't overdo the Chartreuse, just a dash for complexity.  Heering adds a cherry sweetness, so adjust accordingly based on the chocolate's sweetness.  Stir gently to avoid diluting the hot chocolate, and serve immediately.  Enjoy! "
