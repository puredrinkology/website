bartender_tips: 'Chill your glasses and all ingredients beforehand.  Use good quality
  vodka and fresh lime juice for optimal flavor.  Don''t overshake the martini, as
  it will make it cloudy.  Use a fine-mesh strainer to ensure a smooth, clear drink.  A
  splash of Prosecco before serving adds a delightful fizz.  Enjoy responsibly! '

flavor_description: 'The Pornstar Martini is a sweet and tangy tropical delight. The
  vodka provides a smooth base, while the Passoa liqueur delivers a rich, passionfruit-infused
  sweetness. Lime juice adds a refreshing acidity, and the passion fruit juice amplifies
  the tropical fruitiness. The Prosecco topper brings a touch of bubbly effervescence
  and enhances the overall complexity of the cocktail. '
