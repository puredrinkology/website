title: "Sazerac"
description: "The Sazerac, a New Orleans classic, is a member of the **Old Fashioned** family.  Its history dates back to the 1800s, with its roots in a French-American apothecary in New Orleans.  The recipe evolved over time, with the addition of rye whiskey and absinthe. "
flavor_description: "The Sazerac is a bold and complex cocktail with a strong, spicy rye whiskey foundation.  A touch of brandy adds depth, while Demerara gum syrup provides sweetness. The Peychaud's Bitters introduce a slightly medicinal and herbal note, and the absinthe adds a lingering anise and licorice finish, creating a truly unique and unforgettable experience. "
bartender_tips: "Chill your glass! A pre-chilled glass enhances the experience. Use a good quality rye whiskey and absinthe. Stir your Sazerac with ice, not shake, to avoid dilution.  Don't be afraid to adjust the bitters to your preference.  Rinse your glass with absinthe, but not too much, you want the flavor, not a mouthful of it.  Garnish with a lemon twist. Enjoy! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the Appearance of a SazeracImagine a classic cocktail glass, chilled and gleaming. Inside, nestled in a bed of ice, sits a deep amber liquid, its color reminiscent of polished mahogany.  A fine, almost imperceptible haze hangs above the surface, hinting at the absinthe's presence. Tiny, shimmering bubbles rise from the depths, their movement mimicking the rhythmic swirl of a starlit sky. The rim of the glass, coated in a delicate layer of sugar, glistens with a frosted elegance. The overall impression is one of sophistication and complexity, a visual representation of the rich history and bold flavors within. "
