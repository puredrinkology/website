bartender_tips: 'For a velvety smooth Sweet Bananas, use ripe bananas for maximum
  sweetness and flavor. Blend them thoroughly with milk until completely smooth. A
  touch of honey adds depth, so start with a teaspoon and adjust to your taste.  Chill
  the mixture for optimal refreshment.  For a fancier presentation, rim the glass
  with crushed banana chips. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt for Sweet Bananas Cocktail Description:**Imagine a glass filled
  with a creamy, pale yellow liquid, reminiscent of a banana milkshake.  The surface
  shimmers with a delicate sheen, like a thin layer of honey.  Tiny bubbles rise from
  the depths, hinting at a gentle sweetness.  The aroma is an intoxicating blend of
  ripe banana and subtle floral notes from the honey.  What words would you use to
  describe this visual and olfactory experience?** **Bonus:** * **Include a sentence
  describing the consistency of the drink, e.g., The liquid is thick and velvety,
  almost like a mousse.*** **Mention any interesting visual elements, e.g., A single
  banana slice sits on the rim of the glass, adding a touch of rustic charm.** '
