bartender_tips: 'Use a good quality fig syrup, preferably homemade for a more complex
  flavor. A dash of Angostura bitters adds a warm spice that complements the fig.  Muddle
  the fig syrup with the bitters in the bottom of the glass to release its aromas.  Use
  a large ice cube for slower dilution and a smoother drink.  Garnish with a fig slice
  or a sprig of rosemary for a touch of elegance. '

description: 'The Fig Old Fashioned isn''t just a cocktail; it''s an experience. Imagine
  the robust, oaky bourbon you love, but with a gentle nudge towards sweetness and
  depth, thanks to the fig syrup. Figs bring this unique balance of sweetness and
  earthiness that''s perfect for those who like their drinks with a bit of character. '

flavor_description: 'The Fig Old Fashioned is a beautifully balanced cocktail.  The
  fig syrup adds a touch of sweetness with earthy, jammy notes that complement the
  bourbon''s oaky spice.  Aromatic bitters provide a subtle layer of complexity, enhancing
  the fig and bourbon flavors.  The result is a smooth, mellow, and utterly satisfying
  drink with a lingering warmth. '

title: The Fig Old Fashioned Cocktail
visual: '## LLM Prompt:Imagine a **Fig Old Fashioned** cocktail, a sophisticated blend
  of **fig syrup**, **bourbon**, and **aromatic bitters**. Describe its appearance,
  focusing on:* **Color:** Is it a deep amber, a rich mahogany, or perhaps a lighter,
  honeyed hue?* **Texture:** Is it clear and smooth, or does it have a slight cloudiness
  from the fig syrup? * **Garnish:**  What is used to enhance its visual appeal?  Perhaps
  a sprig of fresh rosemary, a thin slice of fig, or a twist of orange peel?* **Glass:**  Does
  it sit in a classic old fashioned glass with a thick base, or a more contemporary
  coupe?Focus on crafting a vivid and sensory description of the cocktail''s appearance.  Don''t
  just describe it, paint a picture with your words. '

#### Why You'll Love It:

**Simplicity**: With only four components (counting ice), it's easy to get right but hard to master. 

**Sophistication**: Figs elevate the drink from bar staple to gourmet delight.

**Versatility**: While it stands alone beautifully, it's also a great foundation for those who like to experiment.


#### Why the Fig Old Fashioned Recipe Stands Out:

**Craftsmanship**: Every ingredient plays its part, from the fig's natural sweetness to the bourbon's depth, all tied together with bitters.

**Unique Twist**: While many play with the Old Fashioned, the fig syrup adds an unexpected yet delightful note.

**Elegance**: It's the perfect drink for those moments when you want something a bit more refined but still approachable.
