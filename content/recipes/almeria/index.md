description: "Almeria belongs to the classic **Egg White Cocktail** family, known for its frothy texture and often featuring spirits like rum and coffee liqueurs. While its exact origin is unclear, its ingredients suggest a Caribbean influence, possibly emerging from Spanish-colonial Almeria, Spain. "
flavor_description: "The Almeria is a smooth, sophisticated cocktail with a balance of sweetness and richness. The dark rum provides warm, caramel notes, while the Kahlua adds a hint of coffee and chocolate. The egg white creates a velvety texture and a subtle, airy foam. This cocktail is best enjoyed neat, and its flavor lingers pleasantly on the palate. "
bartender_tips: "The Almeria is a delightful twist on a classic. To ensure a smooth, frothy texture, **dry shake the egg white and rum first**. This creates a stable foam. **Then, add the Kahlua and shake with ice** for a well-chilled cocktail. **Strain into a chilled coupe glass** and garnish with a coffee bean or a sprinkle of cocoa powder.
