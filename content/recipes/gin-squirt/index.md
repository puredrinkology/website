bartender_tips: 'Muddle strawberries with powdered sugar to release their sweetness.
  Use fresh pineapple juice, not canned, for a more vibrant flavor. Add a dash of
  grenadine at the end for a beautiful color gradient. Don''t over-shake - you want
  a light, bubbly texture. Garnish with a strawberry slice and pineapple wedge for
  a tropical touch. '

description: 'The Gin Squirt belongs to the Fizz family, a group of carbonated cocktails
  with a creamy texture.  While its exact origin is unknown, it likely emerged in
  the 1920s during the American Prohibition era, utilizing readily available ingredients
  and mimicking the popularity of fizzy drinks. '

flavor_description: 'The Gin Squirt is a vibrant and refreshing cocktail.  The juniper-forward
  gin dances with the sweet, tart grenadine and the subtle sweetness of the powdered
  sugar. Pineapple adds a juicy, tropical element, balanced by the bright acidity
  of the strawberries.  A lively fizziness from the carbonated water completes the
  experience, leaving you with a clean and satisfying finish. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt:**Imagine a cocktail called Gin Squirt made with gin, grenadine,
  powdered sugar, pineapple, strawberries, and carbonated water. Describe the appearance
  of this cocktail, focusing on its color, texture, and any visible elements.****Here
  are some prompts to consider:*** **Color:** Is the cocktail primarily red, pink,
  orange, or a blend of these? Does it have a cloudy or clear appearance? * **Texture:**
  Is it a smooth, silky liquid, or does it have a foamy or bubbly head? Are there
  any visible chunks or particles from the fruit?* **Visible elements:** Are there
  slices of pineapple or strawberry floating in the drink? Is the powdered sugar dissolved
  or visible as a dusting on top? **Example output:**The Gin Squirt is a vibrant,
  blush-pink cocktail with a delicate, almost milky texture. A layer of froth sits
  atop the drink, faintly tinged with a coral hue.  Tiny flecks of strawberry pulp
  dance in the light, while a slice of pineapple rests on the rim, adding a touch
  of tropical flair.  A fine dusting of powdered sugar rests upon the surface, like
  a delicate snowfall. '
