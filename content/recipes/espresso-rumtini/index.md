bartender_tips: 'Use a high-quality rum for the best flavor.  Ensure the espresso
  is fresh and strong, and don''t be afraid to add a touch more vanilla syrup if you
  prefer a sweeter drink.  Shake vigorously with ice to chill and dilute the drink.  Garnish
  with a coffee bean or a sprinkle of cocoa powder for an extra touch of flavor and
  elegance. '

  drawing inspiration from the classic Martini. This invigorating blend, likely born
  from a desire to elevate the after-dinner coffee experience, fuses the richness
  of rum with the bold intensity of espresso and the sweetness of vanilla. '
