bartender_tips: 'For a balanced Lazy Coconut Paloma, use a high-quality coconut liqueur
  with subtle sweetness. Fresh grapefruit juice is key, so make sure it''s not overly
  bitter. Build the drink over ice, starting with the liqueur, then juice, and top
  with soda water for optimal carbonation. Don''t overshake, as it will dilute the
  flavors. Garnish with a grapefruit wedge for a refreshing touch. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a Lazy Coconut Paloma cocktail,
  made with Coconut Liqueur, Grapefruit Juice, and Soda Water. Consider the following
  aspects:* **Color:** Is it a vibrant, opaque hue, or a lighter, translucent shade?
  What specific color words best describe it? * **Texture:**  Is it bubbly, smooth,
  or layered? Are there any visible ingredients like ice or fruit?* **Overall impression:**
  Does it evoke a sense of tropical relaxation, or a more refined sophistication?
  * **Specific details:** Are there any unique visual elements, like a garnish or
  the way the ingredients interact?**Example:** Imagine a cocktail with a pale, sun-kissed
  hue, reminiscent of a tropical sunset. The drink is gently fizzy, with tiny bubbles
  dancing on the surface.  A whisper of white coconut cream clings to the rim, creating
  a subtle, creamy contrast against the vibrant grapefruit color. It''s a refreshing
  and visually appealing drink, perfect for a warm summer evening. '
