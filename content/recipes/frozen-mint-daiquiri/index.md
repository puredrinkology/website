bartender_tips: 'For a killer Frozen Mint Daiquiri, muddle the mint gently to release
  its oils, not pulverize it. Use a good quality light rum, and adjust sugar to your
  taste.  Don''t over-blend, as it can become icy. A fine ice consistency is key.
  Garnish with a sprig of mint and a lime wheel. '
