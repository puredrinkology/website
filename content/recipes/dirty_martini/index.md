title: "Dirty Martini"
description: "The Dirty Martini belongs to the Martini family, a sophisticated and iconic cocktail group.  Originating in the late 19th century, the Dirty Martini adds a salty, briny edge to the classic Martini with olive brine, a twist that gained popularity in the mid-20th century. "
flavor_description: "The Dirty Martini is a bold and savory cocktail. The vodka provides a smooth, clean base, while the dry vermouth adds a subtle, herbal dryness. The olive brine introduces a briny, salty character, enhancing the overall savory profile. A touch of lemon brightens the cocktail, creating a delightful balance between salty, savory, and citrusy notes. The olive garnish adds a final touch of salty and briny flavor. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Dirty Martini, use high-quality vodka and dry vermouth.  The key is the olive brine – a little goes a long way. Start with a dash and adjust to taste, ensuring it's just dirty enough.  Garnish with a lemon twist and a plump olive – the colder the better.  Chill everything beforehand for a crisp, satisfying drink. "

visual: "##  LLM Prompt: Describe the visual appeal of a Dirty Martini**Imagine a classic martini glass, chilled and sweating with condensation. Inside, a vibrant, almost ethereal, clear liquid swirls, its surface shimmering with a delicate layer of olive brine. Tiny, translucent ice cubes clink together softly as the glass is tilted.  A plump, green olive, glistening with brine, rests languidly on the rim, its plumpness contrasting with the sleekness of the glass.  A sliver of lemon peel, twisted into a graceful spiral, adds a touch of citrusy color and aromatic complexity. **In a few sentences, describe the visual appeal of this Dirty Martini. Focus on the interplay of textures, colors, and shapes to capture its essence.** "
