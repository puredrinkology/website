fullname: "The Orangeade Cocktail"
shortname: "Orangeade"
description: "Orangeade belongs to the **Fizz** family, a refreshing group of cocktails typically featuring citrus, sugar, and a carbonated top.  While its exact origins are unknown, it likely emerged in the late 19th century, a time when fizzy drinks were gaining popularity. "
flavor_description: "Orangeade is a bright and refreshing cocktail, a harmonious blend of citrusy notes. The sweet orange juice dominates, balanced by the tart bite of lemon. Sugar syrup adds a touch of sweetness, while soda water creates a light, effervescent finish.  The overall taste profile is citrusy, tangy, and invigorating, making it a perfect thirst quencher. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Orangeade, balance is key! Use fresh juices for the best flavor.  Start with a 1:1 ratio of lemon to orange juice, adjust to taste.  A good syrup-to-juice ratio is 1:2, but you can sweeten to your liking.  Soda water is your final touch, adding fizz.  Chill everything before mixing for a refreshing drink.  Don't over-shake, you want the soda to stay bubbly!  Garnish with a citrus wheel for a beautiful touch. "
