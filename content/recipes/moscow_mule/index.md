shortname: "Moscow Mule"
description: "The Moscow Mule is a classic highball, born in the 1940s from a partnership between Smirnoff Vodka and the G.F. Heublein Brothers. This refreshing concoction utilizes the simplicity of a vodka base with the invigorating kick of ginger ale and lime juice. "
flavor_description: "The Moscow Mule is a refreshing and invigorating cocktail. The vodka provides a smooth, clean base, while the lime juice adds a tart and citrusy kick. Ginger ale contributes a spicy, ginger-forward flavor and a bubbly texture. The combination creates a harmonious balance of sweet, sour, and spicy notes, making it a classic and beloved drink. "
bartender_tips: "Use fresh lime juice, not bottled, for the best flavor.  Chill your copper mugs beforehand.  Add the vodka and lime juice directly to the mug, then top with ginger ale and gently stir.  Use good quality ginger ale for a more complex taste.  Don't overfill the mug; leave room for ice and the ginger ale to fizz.  Garnish with a lime wheel and enjoy! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a Moscow Mule.**Imagine a tall, copper mug filled with a refreshing cocktail. The drink is a light, pale amber color with a subtle effervescence, giving it a hazy, sparkling quality.  A thin slice of lime rests on the rim, its green color contrasting beautifully with the copper.  The drink is topped with a generous amount of ice, which creates condensation on the outside of the mug, making it appear even colder and more inviting.****Bonus:**  * **Describe the texture of the drink:**  Is it smooth, bubbly, or slightly icy?* **Include details about the aroma:**  Does it have a strong ginger scent, a hint of lime, or a subtle vodka note? * **Mention any specific details you can see, like condensation, the type of ice, or the clarity of the drink.** "
