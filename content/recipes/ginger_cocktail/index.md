description: "The Ginger Cocktail is a refreshing, citrus-forward drink belonging to the **Gin Sour** family. Though its exact origin is unknown, its simple combination of gin, citrus, and a sweetening agent echoes the classic Sour formula, popularized in the late 19th century.  "
flavor_description: "The Ginger Cocktail is a refreshing and invigorating blend. The spicy ginger syrup bursts forth, followed by the juniper-forward notes of gin. A bright, tart acidity from lime juice cuts through the sweetness, creating a balanced and complex flavor profile. The overall effect is a vibrant and zesty cocktail with a subtle warmth that lingers on the palate. "
bartender_tips: "Freshly muddle the lime to release its oils for a vibrant aroma. Use a high-quality gin for a clean, balanced flavor. Ensure the ginger syrup is properly balanced - not too sweet or too spicy. Shake vigorously with ice to chill and dilute the cocktail. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass, and garnish with a lime wheel for a refreshing finish. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of a Ginger Cocktail made with ginger syrup, gin, and lime juice. Focus on the following aspects:*** **Color:** What is the overall color of the drink? Is it clear, cloudy, or a specific shade? How does the light play on the surface?* **Texture:** Is it still or bubbly? Is there any sediment or cloudiness in the drink? What about the ice?* **Garnish:** What is the garnish used, if any? How does it enhance the visual appeal of the drink? * **Glassware:** What kind of glass is the cocktail served in? Does the glass shape affect the overall presentation? **Example:**Imagine a refreshing ginger cocktail, its pale amber hue glistening under the bar lights. The drink is perfectly clear, with a subtle haze from the ginger syrup. A single, large ice cube chills the liquid, its edges slowly melting, leaving wispy tendrils of cold. A delicate lime wedge, perched on the rim, adds a splash of vibrant green, hinting at the citrusy tang within. "
