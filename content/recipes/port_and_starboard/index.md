description: "The Port and Starboard, a vibrant green concoction, hails from the **layered cocktail** family. Its origins remain shrouded in mystery, likely emerging in the late 19th or early 20th century, a time when layered drinks were gaining popularity.  "
flavor_description: "The Port and Starboard offers a vibrant, sweet and minty experience.  Grenadine's fruity sweetness takes the lead, balanced by the cool, herbal notes of green crème de menthe.  The result is a refreshing, slightly tart cocktail that's perfect for a festive occasion.  Its color is reminiscent of a sunset, making it visually appealing as well.  "
bartender_tips: "The Port and Starboard is a layered beauty, so technique is key. Start by chilling your glass.  Pour grenadine slowly down the side to create the bottom layer.  Carefully float the crème de menthe on top using a spoon, allowing it to gently pour over the back of the spoon.  Don't stir!  A cherry or mint sprig adds a nice touch. "
