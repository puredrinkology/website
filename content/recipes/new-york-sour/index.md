bartender_tips: Use a good quality blended whiskey for a more complex flavor. Freshly
  squeezed lemon juice is key.  Dissolve the sugar in the lemon juice to avoid gritty
  syrup.  Pour the red wine slowly over the back of a spoon to create a distinct layer.
  Garnish with a cherry or lemon twist. Don't over-shake, as it can make the drink
  too cloudy.

flavor_description: 'The New York Sour is a delightful fusion of sweet and tart. The
  blended whiskey provides a smooth base, while the lemon juice adds a bright acidity.
  The simple syrup balances the tartness with a touch of sweetness.  The red wine
  float adds a layer of complexity, offering notes of dark fruit and a subtle dryness
  that lingers on the palate. The cherry garnish provides a final touch of sweetness
  and a burst of vibrant flavor. '
