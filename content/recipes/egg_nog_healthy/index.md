description: "This Healthy Egg Nog is a member of the **Creamy Cocktail** family, often featuring dairy and eggs. Its origins trace back to medieval European posset drinks, combining milk, eggs, and spices. "
flavor_description: "This Healthy Egg Nog is a delightful twist on the classic, offering a creamy, comforting flavor profile. The sweetness of the sugar and condensed milk balances the subtle richness of the egg yolks, while the vanilla extract adds a warm, comforting note. The rum provides a gentle, boozy kick, and the nutmeg creates a warming, spiced finish. It's a luxuriously smooth and satisfying drink, perfect for a holiday celebration or a cozy night in. "
bartender_tips: "For a smooth, creamy Egg Nog, separate the egg yolks and whites. Whisk the yolks with sugar until pale and fluffy, then slowly add the condensed milk, milk, and vanilla.  Fold in the stiffly beaten egg whites.  Finally, stir in the rum and nutmeg.  Chill for at least 2 hours for the flavors to meld and for a more refreshing drink."
