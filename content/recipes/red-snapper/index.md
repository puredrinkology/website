bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Red Snapper, start by chilling your glass and ingredients.
  Use a good quality cranberry juice for a brighter flavor. When shaking, use a firm
  grip to ensure proper dilution. Don''t over-shake; aim for a light, frothy texture.
  Garnish with a lime wedge or a Luxardo cherry for a vibrant touch. '

description: 'The Red Snapper is a fruity, sweet cocktail belonging to the Sour family.  It''s
  a modern invention, likely originating in the late 20th century, combining the sweet,
  nutty notes of Amaretto with the tartness of cranberry juice and the smooth character
  of Crown Royal whiskey. '
family: sour
flavor_description: 'The Red Snapper offers a sweet and tart experience.  The smooth,
  slightly vanilla-infused sweetness of Crown Royal blends perfectly with the almondy
  richness of Amaretto.  A vibrant tartness from cranberry juice cuts through the
  sweetness, creating a refreshing and balanced cocktail.  The overall taste profile
  is reminiscent of a festive holiday drink, but with a sophisticated twist. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt for Describing a Red Snapper Cocktail:Imagine a tall glass,
  frosted with condensation, filled with a vibrant, ruby-red liquid. It''s a symphony
  of colors, with the deep crimson of cranberry juice dominating, punctuated by streaks
  of amber from the Crown Royal whiskey and a subtle hint of golden-brown from the
  Amaretto.  The drink is garnished with a single, glistening cranberry, its dark
  red hue contrasting beautifully with the bright red of the cocktail. Perhaps a small
  sprig of rosemary adds a touch of greenery, or a twist of orange peel graces the
  rim, adding a subtle citrus aroma to the mix. The ice cubes, perfectly clear and
  pristine, chime softly as they jostle in the glass, inviting you to take a sip.  The
  overall effect is one of festive cheer and delicious anticipation. '
