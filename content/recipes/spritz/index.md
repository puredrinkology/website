description: "The Aperol Spritz is a classic member of the Aperitivo family, originating in the Veneto region of Italy in the 19th century. This refreshing, bitter-sweet concoction is perfect for sipping before a meal. "
flavor_description: "The Aperol Spritz is a vibrant and refreshing cocktail. It features a bright, bitter punch from the Aperol, balanced by the delicate sweetness of the Prosecco. The soda water adds a light, bubbly effervescence, making it a perfect summer drink. It's slightly bitter, slightly sweet, and very refreshing, leaving you with a clean finish. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Spritz, chill everything! Use a large wine glass filled with ice, and build the drink directly in it for optimal dilution.  Use a good quality Prosecco for best results, and don't skimp on the soda – it balances the bitterness of the Aperol. Remember, it's a light, refreshing drink, so don't over-pour the Aperol! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the Appearance of a Spritz CocktailImagine a tall, elegant wine glass filled with a vibrant symphony of colors. **Describe the appearance of a Spritz cocktail, focusing on the following:*** **The base:** The Prosecco forms the foundation, a pale, shimmering gold that bubbles playfully at the surface.* **The splash of color:** A vibrant layer of Campari floats atop the Prosecco, its crimson hue adding a striking contrast to the gold. * **The refreshing touch:**  The soda water, light and airy, gently mingles with the Prosecco and Campari, creating a delicate haze that softens the edges of the colors.* **The final touch:**  A thin slice of orange peel, nestled on the rim of the glass, adds a touch of citrusy elegance and releases a subtle aroma of zest.**Remember to focus on the interplay of colors, textures, and the overall visual appeal of the drink.**  This should evoke a sense of the Spritz's refreshing, yet sophisticated, nature.
