visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of a cocktail called Kiss Me Quick, made with the following ingredients:*** Cranberry Vodka * Apfelkorn (a German apple brandy)* Schweppes Russchian (a Russian-inspired bitter lemon soda)* Apple Juice* Ice**Focus on the following aspects:*** **Color:** What is the overall color of the cocktail?  Is it a vibrant red, a deep pink, or something more muted?* **Clarity:** Is it clear, cloudy, or somewhere in between? Are there any visible layers or separation?* **Texture:** Is it smooth, frothy, or layered? Are there any visible ice chunks or fruit pieces?* **Garnish:** Imagine a suitable garnish for this cocktail and describe it, including its color and texture. **Example response:**The Kiss Me Quick presents a vibrant, almost neon-pink hue, a testament to the cranberry vodka base. It's slightly cloudy due to the apple juice, but the Schweppes Russchian contributes a subtle effervescence, creating a playful, layered texture. A thin slice of crisp green apple, perched on the rim of the glass, adds a touch of freshness and a delightful visual contrast. "
