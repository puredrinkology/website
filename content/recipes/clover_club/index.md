title: "Clover Club"
description: "The Clover Club is a classic sour cocktail, a family known for their tart, refreshing flavors. It originated in the late 19th century at the Clover Club in Philadelphia, gaining popularity for its unique egg white foam and vibrant pink hue. "
flavor_description: "The Clover Club is a delightful balance of tart and sweet.  The gin's botanicals provide a dry, juniper-forward backbone, while lemon juice adds a bright acidity. Grenadine contributes a touch of sweetness and a subtle raspberry note.  The egg white adds a silky, creamy texture, making for a luscious and complex cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Clover Club, remember these tips:* **Shake hard:**  Really give it a good shake to emulsify the egg white and create a silky texture.* **Dry shake:**  Before adding ice, shake without ice for 15 seconds to froth the egg white.* **Lemon twist:**  Use a fresh lemon twist, not just juice, to add a vibrant aroma and a touch of visual appeal.* **Ice:**  Use plenty of ice for a well-chilled drink.* **Grenadine:**  Don't overpower the gin with too much grenadine; use it subtly for a hint of sweetness.

visual: "## Describe the visual appeal of a Clover Club cocktail.Imagine a classic cocktail glass, filled with a beautiful, pale pink liquid. The color is reminiscent of a blushing sunset, with delicate hints of citrus and a subtle, pearly shimmer. **The egg white, expertly shaken into a frothy cloud, creates a light, airy head that rests atop the drink like a fluffy cap.**  Tiny bubbles rise from the depths, adding a touch of effervescence to the scene.  **The glass itself is immaculately chilled, frosted with condensation**, adding a touch of ethereal coolness to the overall presentation.  A single, vibrant **lemon twist**, nestled gracefully on the rim,  releases a burst of fresh citrus aroma, completing the sensory experience.  **The Clover Club is a cocktail that is as visually appealing as it is delicious.** "
