description: "The Bluebird is a vibrant twist on the classic Gin Sour family. While its precise origins are unclear, it likely emerged in the mid-20th century, drawing inspiration from the popularity of blue cura√ßao and other vibrant liqueurs. Its combination of citrus, gin, and bitters creates a refreshingly tart and slightly bitter cocktail, ideal for a summer afternoon. "
flavor_description: "The Bluebird is a refreshing and vibrant cocktail.  Gin's juniper notes intertwine with the citrusy sweetness of Triple Sec and Blue Curacao.  A whisper of bitters adds complexity, while the maraschino cherry and lemon peel provide a touch of sweetness and citrus zest.  The overall taste is bright, balanced, and slightly tart. "
bartender_tips: "This cocktail is a classic for a reason.  The key is to balance the sweetness from the Triple Sec and Blue Curacao with the dry gin and a dash of bitters. Don't over-muddle the cherry; a gentle press releases flavor without making the drink cloudy.  A long, thin peel of lemon adds a citrusy aroma without overwhelming the taste.  Enjoy! "
