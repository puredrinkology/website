title: "The B-53 Shot"
fullname: "The B-53 Shot"
shortname: "B-53"
description: "The B-53, a harmonious blend of coffee, anise, and orange liqueur, belongs to the Coffee Cocktail family, a sub-category of the classic After-Dinner Drink. Its origin, though uncertain, is likely rooted in the early 20th century, reflecting the popularity of layered cocktails during that era. "
flavor_description: "The B-53 is a harmonious blend of coffee, anise, and citrus. Kahlua's rich coffee and chocolate notes are balanced by Sambuca's licorice sweetness and Grand Marnier's bright orange flavor.  The combination creates a smooth, slightly sweet, and slightly spicy taste with a lingering warmth.  "
bartender_tips: "The B-53 is a sweet, layered cocktail with a kick. To achieve the distinct layers, pour slowly and carefully. Use a bar spoon to gently push the Sambuca to the bottom, then the Grand Marnier, leaving the Kahlua on top.  A slow pour with a gentle hand is key!  This creates the visual appeal and allows each liqueur to maintain its distinct flavor profile.  Garnish with a lemon twist or a coffee bean for a nice touch. "
