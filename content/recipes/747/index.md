description: "The 747 is a creamy, sweet cocktail belonging to the **liqueur-based cocktail family**. Its origin is unknown, but its simple combination of Kahlua, Baileys, and Frangelico suggests a likely American invention, popularized in the 1980s and 90s. "
flavor_description: "The 747 is a smooth and decadent cocktail with a rich, creamy texture.  The Kahlua provides a deep coffee flavor, balanced by the sweet, nutty notes of Frangelico. Baileys Irish Cream adds a velvety smoothness and hints of vanilla and chocolate, creating a harmonious blend of sweet and indulgent flavors. "
bartender_tips: "The 747 is a layered drink, so technique is key. Chill your glasses beforehand.  Pour the Kahlua in first, followed by Baileys slowly, aiming for the side of the glass to keep it separate.  Top with Frangelico gently, as it's the lightest and floats.  A bar spoon can help guide the heavier liqueurs down. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a 747 cocktail.**Context:** The 747 cocktail is made with Kahlua, Baileys Irish Cream, and Frangelico. **Prompt:**Imagine a cocktail glass filled with a beautiful blend of three distinct layers. * **The bottom layer:** Rich, dark brown, almost black, like a smooth, velvety chocolate sauce. * **The middle layer:** A creamy, off-white hue, reminiscent of fresh Irish cream.* **The top layer:** A delicate, amber-gold color, hinting at the nutty sweetness of Frangelico. The layers are distinct yet seamlessly blend together, creating a visually captivating experience. **Focus on:*** The specific colors of each layer.* How the layers interact with each other (e.g., sharp lines, gradual transitions).* The overall impression of the cocktail's appearance (e.g., decadent, sophisticated, elegant).**Example response:**The 747 presents a striking visual spectacle. Its deep, dark base, reminiscent of molten chocolate, is crowned by a smooth, off-white layer of Irish cream. A thin, golden band of Frangelico delicately tops the composition, creating a stunning contrast of color. The layers are crisp and distinct, yet they subtly blend together, revealing the cocktail's rich and layered complexity. "
