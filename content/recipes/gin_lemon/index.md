description: "The Gin Lemon is a classic Sour, a cocktail family that originated in the 18th century. Its simplicity is a hallmark of the style, showcasing the bright acidity of lemon juice and the botanicals of gin, creating a refreshing and invigorating drink. "
flavor_description: "Gin Lemon is a crisp and refreshing cocktail that balances the juniper-forward notes of gin with the tartness of fresh lemon juice.  The lemon peel adds a subtle citrus zest and aromatic complexity. The chilled ice keeps the drink cool and invigorating, making it perfect for warm days or a light, refreshing pre-dinner drink. "
bartender_tips: "For a crisp Gin Lemon, use a good quality gin and fresh lemon juice. Muddle the lemon peel to release oils before adding ice and gin.  Shake vigorously to chill and dilute, and strain into a chilled coupe. Garnish with a lemon twist for extra citrus aroma. Don't over-muddle the peel, or it'll make the drink bitter. "
