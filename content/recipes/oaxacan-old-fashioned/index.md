bartender_tips: 'For a balanced Oaxacan Old Fashioned, use a good quality, smoky Mezcal
  and a high-proof Tequila.  Dissolve the Demerara Gum Syrup in a little hot water
  to create a smooth syrup.  Don''t over-muddle the orange peel, just a light squeeze
  to release oils.  Use a large ice cube for slow dilution and a rocks glass to retain
  the smoky aroma.  Finish with a dash of chocolate bitters and a flamed orange peel
  for a dramatic touch. '

flavor_description: 'This Oaxacan Old Fashioned is a complex and smoky cocktail. The
  Demerara Gum Syrup adds a rich, caramel sweetness, while the tequila provides a
  bright, vegetal backbone. The smoky notes of the mezcal come through beautifully,
  enhanced by the subtle, bitter chocolate notes of the bitters. The result is a truly
  unique and memorable drink that is both sweet and savory, with a lingering warmth. '
