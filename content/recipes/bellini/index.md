title: "Bellini"
description: "The Bellini, a vibrant pink delight, belongs to the Fizz family, characterized by its bubbly, refreshing nature. This classic Italian cocktail, created in the 1930s at Harry's Bar in Venice, gets its name from the Venetian artist, Giovanni Bellini, due to its resemblance to his paintings. "
flavor_description: "The Bellini is a delicate dance of sweetness and bubbles. The peach schnapps brings a vibrant, ripe peach flavor with a hint of sweetness. This sweetness is balanced by the dryness and acidity of the Champagne, creating a harmonious and refreshing experience. The bubbles add a playful lightness, making it a perfect aperitivo. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Bellini, chill your champagne flute well. Use high-quality peach schnapps, not flavored vodka.  Pour a shot of schnapps into the glass and top with chilled champagne.  A gentle pour, avoiding too much foam, creates a beautiful layered effect. Garnish with a peach slice or a few fresh peach slices for an extra touch. "
