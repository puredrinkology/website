shortname: "Vodka Slime"
description: "Vodka Slime is a refreshing highball, a cocktail family known for their simple, tall structure and use of soda or a mixer. Though its specific origin is unknown, it's likely a modern creation, a playful twist on classic vodka highballs like the Vodka Tonic or Vodka Soda. "
flavor_description: "Vodka Slime is a refreshing and tangy cocktail. The Sprite provides a crisp, citrusy sweetness, while the lime juice adds a tart and zesty bite. The vodka adds a smooth, clean alcohol base, balancing out the sweetness and acidity. Overall, it's a light and easy-drinking cocktail perfect for hot days. "
bartender_tips: "For a truly refreshing Vodka Slime, use fresh lime juice, not bottled.  It makes all the difference!  Shake hard with ice to ensure proper chilling and dilution.  Don't over-pour the vodka, as it should be a subtle presence.  And most importantly, rim your glass with sugar for that extra touch of sweetness! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of Vodka SlimeImagine a tall, frosted glass filled with a luminous green liquid. The drink is topped with a delicate layer of white foam, creating a distinct contrast with the vibrant green underneath. Tiny bubbles rise from the depths of the glass, creating a playful, effervescent effect. The lime juice adds a subtle, almost imperceptible, haze to the otherwise crystal clear liquid. The overall appearance is reminiscent of a whimsical, luminous green slime, hence the name Vodka Slime.  Focus on the details of the color, texture, and the contrast between the foam and the liquid to accurately portray the visual appeal of this cocktail. "
