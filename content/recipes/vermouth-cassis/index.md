visual: '## LLM Prompt for Vermouth Cassis Description:**Imagine a tall, elegant glass
  filled with a beautiful ombre effect. The bottom third is a deep, rich crimson hue,
  like a ruby held up to the light. This vibrant color gradually fades upwards, blending
  into a pale, straw-like yellow, reminiscent of the golden sunset. The drink is topped
  with a delicate layer of fine, pearlescent bubbles, resembling a soft, ethereal
  mist. How would you describe the visual appeal of this layered cocktail, highlighting
  its colors, textures, and overall aesthetic?** '
