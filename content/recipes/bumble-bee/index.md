bartender_tips: 'The Bumble Bee is a layered cocktail, so precision is key.  Chill
  your glasses thoroughly and use a bar spoon to slowly pour each liqueur, starting
  with the heaviest (Baileys), followed by Kahlua, and finish with the lightest (Sambuca).  Don''t
  stir! The layers are the beauty of the drink. A gentle pour and a steady hand will
  create a stunning visual that''s as delicious as it looks. '

description: 'The Bumble Bee belongs to the layered shot family, a popular style originating
  in the late 20th century.  Its distinct layered appearance, achieved by carefully
  pouring the heavier Baileys, followed by Kahlua, and finally the lighter Sambuca,  creates
  a visually striking drink. '

flavor_description: 'The Bumble Bee is a creamy, decadent delight. The Baileys Irish
  Cream provides a smooth, sweet base with notes of chocolate and vanilla. Kahlua
  adds a rich coffee flavor and a touch of bitterness, while the Sambuca lends a unique
  licorice and anise kick. The combination creates a well-balanced, slightly sweet
  cocktail with a lingering, complex finish. '
