title: "Egg Nog #4"
description: "This decadent concoction belongs to the **Creamy Cocktail** family, a group known for their rich textures and often festive origins.  While its specific history is unclear,  Egg Nog #4 likely draws inspiration from traditional egg nog recipes, popularized in the 18th century, which combined spirits, eggs, and spices. "
flavor_description: "Egg Nog #4 is a decadent and complex treat. The creamy richness of the egg yolks and milk is balanced by the subtle sweetness of the sugar and vanilla. Light rum and bourbon add warmth and spice, while a touch of salt enhances the flavors. The whipped cream and egg white create a velvety texture, while a dusting of nutmeg provides a final touch of aromatic warmth. "
bartender_tips: "When making Egg Nog #4,  ensure your egg yolks are at room temperature for optimal emulsification.  Whip the egg whites separately for a frothy top.  Don't over-whip the cream; it should be soft peaks.  Measure your booze carefully and add the vanilla extract at the end to enhance its flavor.  Chill thoroughly before serving and grate fresh nutmeg for a beautiful finish. "
