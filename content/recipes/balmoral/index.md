description: "The Balmoral is a classic variation of the Manhattan, belonging to the esteemed family of whiskey-based cocktails. While its exact origins remain shrouded in mystery, it's likely to have emerged in the early 20th century, possibly named after the iconic Scottish castle. "
flavor_description: "The Balmoral boasts a complex, balanced flavor profile. The smoky depth of Scotch intertwines with the sweetness of sweet vermouth, while dry vermouth adds a subtle dryness. Aromatic bitters provide a touch of complexity, with hints of orange peel and herbal notes. The result is a sophisticated, well-rounded cocktail that's both invigorating and approachable. "
bartender_tips: "The Balmoral is a classic, but a subtle one.  Use a good quality Scotch, and don't skimp on the vermouths.  Chill your ingredients well, especially the vermouths.  A dash of bitters adds complexity, but don't overdo it.  Stir, don't shake, to keep the cocktail smooth.  Garnish with an orange twist for a classic touch. "
