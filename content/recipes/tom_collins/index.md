shortname: "Tom Collins"
description: "The Tom Collins is a classic gin sour, a cocktail family known for its tart, refreshing flavors.  Its origin is debated, with claims ranging from a 19th-century New York bartender to a British comedian's joke. "
flavor_description: "The Tom Collins is a refreshing and tart classic. Gin's juniper notes dance with zesty lemon, balanced by a touch of sweetness. The club soda adds effervescence and crispness, making it a delightful, light-bodied cocktail. The maraschino cherry adds a subtle sweetness and the orange a touch of citrusy aroma. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Tom Collins, use a good quality gin and fresh lemon juice.  Make sure to shake the gin, lemon juice, and sugar with ice to thoroughly chill the drink.  Don't over-shake, though - you want it to be well-mixed, not foamy.  Top with club soda and garnish with a maraschino cherry and an orange slice. This will ensure the drink is balanced and refreshing. "

visual: "##  LLM Prompt: **Imagine a tall, elegant glass filled with ice and a shimmering, effervescent liquid. The drink is a pale, crystalline shade of yellow, almost like a lemon sorbet, with tiny bubbles dancing on the surface. A bright, juicy lemon slice rests on the rim, alongside a plump, ruby red maraschino cherry, suspended on a decorative toothpick. The aroma is invigorating, with a crisp, citrusy note that blends beautifully with the subtle sweetness of the sugar and the refreshing essence of gin. Describe this cocktail, capturing its visual appeal and the sensory experience it evokes.** "
