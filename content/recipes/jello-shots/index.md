bartender_tips: "Use high-quality vodka for a cleaner taste.  Don't overcook the Jello,\
  \ it should be just slightly thickened.  Let the Jello mixture cool completely before\
  \ pouring into molds.  Use a piping bag for even distribution and a professional\
  \ look.  For a fun twist, add fruit pur\xE9e or edible glitter! "

  of **Party Shots**, a modern, informal category.  Their origins are likely rooted
  in the 1980s, arising from the desire for a fun, portable, and easily consumed way
  to enjoy alcohol. '

flavor_description: "Jello shots offer a surprisingly complex taste profile. The vodka\
  \ provides a clean, sharp alcohol burn, while the Jello contributes a sweet, fruity\
  \ flavor, often enhanced by the chosen flavoring. The water balances out the sweetness\
  \ and alcohol, creating a smooth, refreshing finish. The texture, of course, is\
  \ the defining element \u2013 wobbly, jiggly, and uniquely satisfying. "

visual: '## LLM Prompt for Describing Jello Shots:Imagine a tray of colorful, shimmering
  cubes. They''re small, about the size of a dice, and have a gelatinous, wobbly texture.
  The colors are vibrant and varied, ranging from bright red and orange to a deep
  purple or a sunshine yellow. Each cube is translucent, allowing a glimpse of the
  alcohol hidden within. The surface is slightly sticky, reflecting the light in a
  mesmerizing way. These tiny, tempting cubes are known as Jello shots, a playful
  and potent treat. Describe the visual appeal of these miniature, boozy delights,
  focusing on their color, texture, and the way they catch the light. '
