description: "The Queen Charlotte belongs to the **Highball** family, characterized by their tall, mixed drinks with a base spirit and a mixer. This simple concoction likely originated in the early 20th century, likely inspired by the popularity of red wine cocktails and the growing trend of soda-based drinks. "
flavor_description: "The Queen Charlotte is a delightful balance of sweet and tart. The red wine provides a rich, fruity base, while the grenadine adds a touch of sweetness and a vibrant ruby hue. The lemon-lime soda provides a refreshing effervescence and a subtle citrus tang, making this cocktail both complex and approachable. It's a perfect choice for a warm afternoon or a light and airy aperitif. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Queen Charlotte, start with a good quality dry red wine. Don't skimp on the grenadine â€“ it adds the sweetness and vibrant color. Use a chilled glass and add the soda last for a bubbly fizz.  A splash of lemon juice can brighten the flavor. Adjust the proportions to your liking, but keep the red wine dominant for a true Queen's touch. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of a cocktail called Queen Charlotte, which is made with red wine, grenadine, and lemon-lime soda.  Be sure to include details about:*** **Color:** Is it a single, uniform color, or does it have layers? What is the overall tone of the color - light, dark, vibrant, muted? * **Clarity:** Is it clear, cloudy, or opaque? * **Texture:**  Is it smooth, bubbly, or layered with different densities? * **Garnish:**  If any, describe the garnish and how it is placed in the drink. **Example:** Imagine a Queen Charlotte served in a tall glass with ice. The drink is a beautiful, layered masterpiece. The bottom layer is a vibrant ruby red, showcasing the rich color of the red wine. Above it, a layer of vibrant, almost fluorescent red grenadine sits, creating a distinct boundary between the two. Finally, a crown of refreshing lemon-lime soda adds a delicate, pale yellow hue and a gentle effervescence. A delicate sprig of mint, perched on the edge of the glass, adds a touch of green and freshness. "
