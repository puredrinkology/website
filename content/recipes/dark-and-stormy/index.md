bartender_tips: 'Use a high-quality dark rum for the best flavor.  Fresh ginger beer
  is ideal, but if using bottled, chill it thoroughly for a crisp taste. Build the
  drink over ice in a highball glass, pouring rum first, then ginger beer.  Gently
  stir to combine, leaving a bit of fizz on top. Garnish with a lime wedge or a sprig
  of fresh mint for an extra touch. '

  beer''s effervescence and subtle spice, resulting in a well-rounded drink that''s
  both invigorating and comforting. '
