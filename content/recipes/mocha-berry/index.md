  \ quality coffee, freshly brewed, for the best flavor. When adding Chambord, use\
  \ a bar spoon to gently swirl it into the coffee for a beautiful marbled effect.\
  \  Dust with cocoa powder right before serving, ensuring a fresh, unclumped coating.\
  \ A light touch with the whipped cream is key \u2013 you want it to compliment,\
  \ not overwhelm the other flavors. "

flavor_description: 'The Mocha-Berry is a harmonious blend of rich coffee and sweet
  berry notes.  The Chambord''s raspberry and black raspberry flavors intertwine with
  the coffee''s roasted bitterness, creating a delightful complexity.  Cocoa powder
  adds a subtle chocolate depth, balanced by the smooth, airy whipped cream.  Expect
  a decadent, slightly tart, and ultimately satisfying experience. '
