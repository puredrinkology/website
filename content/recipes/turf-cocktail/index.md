bartender_tips: 'Chill your glass and ingredients beforehand.  Use a high-quality
  dry vermouth, as it''s the base flavor.  Don''t over-shake the cocktail; a gentle
  stir is best to preserve the delicate aromatics.  Use fresh orange peel, and express
  its oils over the drink before dropping it in.  Finally, a dash of bitters adds
  complexity.  Enjoy! '

flavor_description: 'The Turf Cocktail is a sophisticated and complex drink.  The
  dry vermouth and gin provide a crisp, herbal backbone, while the anis adds a subtle
  licorice note.  Bitters contribute a touch of bitterness and complexity, and the
  orange peel offers a bright citrus aroma. The result is a well-balanced cocktail
  with a dry, herbal, and slightly spicy finish. '
