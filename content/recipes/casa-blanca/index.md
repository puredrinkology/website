bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Casa Blanca, chill your ingredients beforehand. Use
  fresh lime juice for optimal flavor. Shake vigorously with ice to ensure proper
  dilution and a frosty, refreshing drink. Strain into a chilled coupe glass. Don''t
  skimp on the Maraschino liqueur; it adds a delightful complexity. Garnish with a
  lime wheel for a touch of elegance. '

title: The Casa Blanca Cocktail
visual: 'Imagine a cocktail that evokes the vibrancy of a sun-drenched Caribbean beach.
  **Casa Blanca**, a harmonious blend of **light rum**, **triple sec**, **lime juice**,
  and **maraschino liqueur**, shimmers in a frosted glass. The base is a pale golden
  hue, hinting at the sweetness of the rum and triple sec. A vibrant, lime-green rim,
  achieved with a touch of sugar and lime juice, contrasts beautifully with the golden
  center.  The surface is crowned with a delicate, fluffy cloud of maraschino cherry
  foam, adding a touch of playful pink to the composition.  The entire cocktail is
  an ode to the tropics, promising a sweet and tart taste experience that leaves a
  lingering memory of sunshine and island breezes. '
