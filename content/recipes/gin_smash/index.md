shortname: "Gin Smash"
author: "Pure Drinkology"
description: "The Gin Smash is a refreshing variation on the classic smash cocktail family, known for muddled fruits and herbs. Its origins likely stem from the 19th century, a time when gin-based cocktails were booming in popularity, drawing inspiration from the potent and flavorful punch bowls of the era. "
flavor_description: "The Gin Smash bursts with refreshing citrus and minty coolness. The gin's juniper and botanical notes are balanced by the sweetness of sugar, while the orange adds a bright, tangy layer. The carbonated water provides a crisp effervescence, leaving a clean and invigorating finish with a subtle cherry sweetness. "
bartender_tips: "Use a muddler to gently crush the mint and orange, not pulverize them.  A few pieces of orange zest will add complexity.  Sugar syrup helps dissolve quickly, but a simple syrup with a touch of orange blossom water elevates the flavor.  For a refreshing fizz, use a good quality tonic water and gently top with ice to avoid dilution.  Garnish with a fresh mint sprig and a maraschino cherry. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing the Visuals of a Gin Smash:Imagine a tall, clear glass filled with ice. The drink itself is a vibrant emerald green, thanks to a generous amount of muddled fresh mint leaves. Tiny bubbles from the carbonated water rise to the surface, creating a shimmering effect. A thin slice of juicy orange rests on the rim of the glass, adding a touch of bright orange to the composition. A plump, dark cherry sits at the bottom of the drink, nestled amidst the mint. The overall effect is refreshing and inviting, with a delicate balance of vibrant green and refreshing orange hues. "
