shortname: "Hot Toddy"
description: "The Hot Toddy is a classic warming drink cocktail, often enjoyed during cold weather.  Originating in the 18th century, it's a comforting blend of whiskey, honey, spices, and citrus - a perfect remedy for a winter chill. "
flavor_description: "The Hot Toddy is a warm hug in a mug.  The whiskey provides a robust, warming base, balanced by the honey's sweet, floral notes.  A gentle spice from cinnamon and cloves adds complexity, while the lemon brightens the palate with its tartness.  The combination creates a comforting and soothing drink, ideal for a chilly evening. "
bartender_tips: "For the perfect Hot Toddy, start with a good quality whiskey. Use real honey, not artificial sweeteners.  Don't overcook the cinnamon and cloves, just a simmer is enough to infuse the flavor.  Use freshly squeezed lemon juice for brightness.  A splash of hot water can help dissolve the honey and create a smooth texture.  Lastly, garnish with a lemon wedge and cinnamon stick for that classic touch. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing a Hot Toddy:Imagine a steaming mug filled with a golden amber liquid.  The surface shimmers with tiny bubbles, each reflecting the warm light from a nearby fireplace.  A delicate wisp of steam curls upwards, carrying the aroma of cinnamon and cloves.  Within the liquid, a thin slice of lemon floats, its pale yellow contrasting with the deep brown of the whiskey.  The edges of the mug are frosted, hinting at the warmth within.  Describe the Hot Toddy, capturing its visual appeal and inviting aroma. "
