bartender_tips: 'Muddle the mint gently to release its flavor, but avoid bruising
  it.  Use fresh lemon juice for the best tang, and make sure your ginger syrup is
  spicy and your raspberry syrup is tart.  Shake vigorously with ice for a good chill
  and frothy head. Top with soda for a refreshing fizz. Enjoy responsibly! '

title: The Monongahela Mule Cocktail
visual: '## LLM Prompt for Monongahela Mule Description:**Imagine a tall, copper mug
  filled with a vibrant, layered cocktail. The base is a rich amber hue, reminiscent
  of aged rye whiskey, with a subtle, almost smoky undertone. Atop this rests a bright
  pink layer, courtesy of the raspberry syrup, punctuated by delicate green specks
  of fresh mint. The top layer is a crisp, almost translucent white, representing
  the soda water, which gently bubbles up, creating a soft effervescence. A single,
  thin slice of lemon rests on the rim, adding a touch of citrus zest to the visual
  symphony. **Describe the Monongahela Mule using vivid language and sensory details,
  capturing the colors, textures, and overall visual appeal. Focus on the interplay
  of the different layers and the overall impression the drink evokes.** '
