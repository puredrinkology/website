description: The Dirty Nipple Shot is a decadent layered shooter, combining the rich
  coffee notes of Kahlua, the anise-forward bite of Sambuca, and the creamy smoothness
  of Baileys Irish Cream. This playful drink is part of the layered shot family, where
  each distinct liqueur adds a flavorful and visually appealing layer. Perfect for
  parties or a sweet post-dinner treat.
