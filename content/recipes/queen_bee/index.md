Its origin likely lies in the modern era, a creative fusion of classic and contemporary flavors. "
flavor_description: "The Queen Bee is a complex and alluring cocktail. The coffee brandy provides a rich, roasted base with hints of chocolate and caramel.  Lime vodka adds a bright, citrusy zing, while the sherry offers a dry, nutty complexity with notes of dried fruit. These elements intertwine to create a harmonious blend that is both sophisticated and refreshing. "
bartender_tips: "To make your Queen Bee sing, remember these tips: * **Chill everything**:  Cold ingredients are key for a refreshing drink.* **Use good quality ingredients**: The brandy and sherry really make a difference.* **Shake hard**: Don't be shy with the shaker!  A good hard shake will create a beautiful frothy head.* **Strain carefully**:  Avoid any bits of lime from making it into the glass.* **Garnish thoughtfully**: A lime wheel or a sprig of rosemary adds a nice touch.
