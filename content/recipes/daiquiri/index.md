description: "The Daiquiri, a member of the Sour family, hails from the early 20th century in Cuba. Its simplicity – light rum, lime juice, and sugar – belies its sophistication, showcasing the bright, acidic flavors of its ingredients. "
flavor_description: "The Daiquiri is a crisp, refreshing cocktail with a bright, tart lime flavor. The light rum provides a subtle sweetness and a smooth, clean finish. The powdered sugar adds a touch of sweetness and body, balancing out the tartness of the lime. The overall taste is a harmonious blend of sweet, tart, and smooth, making it a classic and beloved cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Daiquiri, fresh lime juice is key. Don't use bottled, the flavor won't be the same.  A good quality light rum is essential, and don't be shy with the sugar!  You want it sweet, but balanced with the lime.  Shake hard with ice to chill it down, and strain into a chilled coupe glass.  A touch of simple syrup can help if the sugar isn't dissolving properly.
