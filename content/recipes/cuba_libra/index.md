description: "The Cuba Libre, a member of the Highball family, boasts a simple yet invigorating blend. Born in Havana, Cuba, during the early 20th century, this iconic cocktail was initially a celebratory drink for the liberation of Cuba from Spanish rule. "
flavor_description: "The Cuba Libre is a refreshing and balanced cocktail. The dark rum provides a rich, molasses-forward sweetness, while the lime juice adds a tart and citrusy counterpoint. Coca-Cola contributes a touch of caramel sweetness and a hint of spice, while the ice chills the drink and dilutes it for a smooth finish. Expect a slightly sweet, fruity, and slightly spicy experience with a hint of cola complexity. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Cuba Libre, start with high-quality dark rum. Muddle the lime wedge directly in the glass for maximum freshness, not just juice. Use good quality cola, the sweetness balances the rum perfectly. Fill with ice and top with cola, gently stirring to avoid diluting the rum. Garnish with a lime wheel and enjoy! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a Cuba Libre cocktail. **Imagine a tall, frosted glass filled with ice. The amber glow of dark rum shines through the chilled Coca-Cola, creating a layered effect. Tiny bubbles rise from the depths, bringing a refreshing fizz to the surface. A wedge of lime rests on the rim, its vibrant green color contrasting beautifully with the dark depths of the drink. The overall effect is a refreshing, vibrant, and slightly mischievous cocktail, perfect for a hot summer day.** "
