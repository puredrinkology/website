bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Horse''s Neck, chill your glass and brandy beforehand.
  Use a good quality brandy with strong notes. Don''t over-muddle the lemon peel -
  just express its oils over the drink. Gently pour the ginger ale to maintain its
  fizz, and add just a dash of bitters for complexity. Finally, garnish with a long,
  curled lemon peel. '

title: The Horses Neck Cocktail
visual: '## LLM Prompt:Imagine a tall, elegant glass filled with a pale amber liquid,
  like a sunset over a sandy beach.  The top is crowned with a mountain of ice, its
  edges sparkling like tiny diamonds in the dim light.  A single, curled lemon peel,
  its edges tinged with a hint of green, peeks out from the ice, adding a touch of
  citrusy elegance.  The drink itself is alive with tiny bubbles, a testament to the
  ginger ale that gives it its effervescence.  The air around it is subtly infused
  with a hint of spice, the whisper of bitters adding complexity to the sweetness
  of the brandy.  **Describe this cocktail in detail, focusing on its visual appeal,
  color, and textures.  Pay special attention to the presence of the lemon peel, the
  ice, and the bubbling ginger ale.** '
