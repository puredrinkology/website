description: "Mulled wine, a warming winter beverage, belongs to the Hot Cocktails family. Its origins trace back to ancient Rome, where wine was spiced with herbs and honey for medicinal and celebratory purposes. "
flavor_description: "Mulled wine is a warm, comforting hug in a glass. The sweetness of the sugar blends with the tartness of the lemon, creating a balanced base. The red wine adds a rich, fruity depth, while the cloves and cinnamon infuse a spicy, warming complexity. A touch of brandy adds a smooth, boozy kick. Overall, it's a complex, fragrant, and festive drink perfect for chilly evenings. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Mulled Wine, simmer gently, don't boil! This prevents the alcohol from evaporating and the flavors from becoming bitter.  Use quality red wine and brandy for a richer flavor. Add the sugar last to avoid caramelization. Strain before serving to remove spices and enjoy warm! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a Mulled Wine cocktail. Imagine a steaming mug filled with the drink. Focus on the color, clarity, and any visible ingredients. Mention the presence of steam and any floating spices or fruit peels. **Consider these aspects:*** **Color:** Is it a deep red, a lighter ruby, or something else?* **Clarity:** Is it clear, or does it have a slightly cloudy appearance?* **Steam:** Is there a plume of steam rising from the mug, and what color is it?* **Floating Ingredients:** Are there any visible cloves, cinnamon sticks, or lemon peel floating in the wine? How do they appear?**Example Output:**A steaming mug of mulled wine reveals a deep ruby red liquid, slightly clouded by the swirling spices. A plume of warm, fragrant steam rises from the surface, carrying with it the scent of cloves and cinnamon. A few plump cloves and a cinnamon stick, both softened by the heat, bob gently in the depths, while a piece of lemon peel clings to the edge of the mug, adding a touch of citrusy brightness. "
