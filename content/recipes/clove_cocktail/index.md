description: "The Clove Cocktail is a member of the classic Sweet Vermouth cocktail family, often featuring bittersweet liqueurs like sloe gin.  Though its exact origin is unknown, its combination of botanicals and sweet-tart flavors suggests a mid-19th century origin, possibly from a London or New York bar. "

The wine adds a subtle layer of complexity, enhancing the berry notes from the sloe gin.  A hint of clove lingers on the palate, adding a warm, spiced dimension. "
