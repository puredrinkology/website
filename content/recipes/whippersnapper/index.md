fullname: "The Whippersnapper Cocktail"
shortname: "Whippersnapper"
description: "The Whippersnapper, a vibrant and refreshing cocktail, belongs to the Sour family. Its origins are uncertain, but its use of bourbon, citrus, and bitters points to a classic American cocktail tradition, likely emerging in the early 20th century. "
flavor_description: "The Whippersnapper is a vibrant, tart cocktail with a playful sweetness. The raspberry gum syrup lends a juicy, candy-like note, balanced by the sharp citrus of lemon juice. Bourbon adds warmth and spice, while orange liqueur provides a hint of floral sweetness. A touch of aromatic bitters adds a subtle complexity, rounding out the flavor profile. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality bourbon for a richer flavor profile.  Make sure the raspberry gum syrup is well-dissolved, or you'll get a gritty texture. Don't skimp on the bitters!  A couple of dashes really help to round out the flavors and add complexity.  Shake well with ice to ensure a good chill and dilution.  Strain into a chilled coupe glass for a refreshing and elegant presentation. "
