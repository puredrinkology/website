bartender_tips: 'A good Gin & Soda is all about balance. Use a high-quality gin with
  a distinct character. Fill your glass with ice first, then add the gin and a good
  squeeze of fresh lime juice. Top with chilled soda water, keeping the bubbles lively.
  Garnish with a lime wheel and enjoy the refreshing simplicity! '

visual: '## LLM Prompt: Describe the Gin and SodaImagine a tall, elegant glass filled
  with ice. The crystal clarity of the ice is slightly obscured by a pale, shimmering
  liquid - gin, its subtle juniper notes just visible in the light. Above the gin,
  a cascade of effervescent soda water rises, creating a playful, bubbly texture.
  A thin sliver of lime, expertly squeezed, floats on the surface, its vibrant green
  contrasting beautifully with the clear drink. The rim of the glass is lightly frosted,
  hinting at the refreshing coolness within. Describe the overall appearance of this
  Gin and Soda, paying close attention to the color, texture, and any visual details
  that evoke its refreshing nature. '
