bartender_tips: 'Start with a good quality whiskey, it''s the star of the show. Use
  a beer that complements the whiskey, a pale ale or IPA work well. Freshly squeezed
  lemonade adds brightness, so don''t be shy with the citrus.  Use a tall glass filled
  with ice to keep the drink chilled, and don''t over-mix - you want a layered, balanced
  cocktail, not a beer-slushy.  Enjoy! '

description: "Owen's Grandmother's Revenge belongs to the Highball family, a refreshing\
  \ blend of spirits and mixers. While its precise origin is unknown, the combination\
  \ of whiskey, beer, and lemonade likely arose from the practice of highballing \u2013\
  \ using soda water to dilute strong spirits, popularized in the early 20th century. "
