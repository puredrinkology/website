bartender_tips: 'For a smooth Jamaica Kiss, use high-quality coffee liqueur and light
  rum. Chill your milk beforehand for a refreshing drink. Shake with ice vigorously
  to ensure proper dilution and a frosty texture. Strain into a chilled coupe glass,
  leaving the ice behind. Garnish with a coffee bean or cinnamon stick for a sophisticated
  touch. '
