bartender_tips: 'For a vibrant Vodka Lemon, use fresh lemon juice and a generous twist
  of peel for maximum citrus aroma.  Muddle the peel gently to release oils, but avoid
  bitterness.  Shake vigorously with ice to chill and dilute, ensuring a crisp, refreshing
  drink.  Strain into a chilled glass and garnish with a lemon wedge.  Enjoy! '
