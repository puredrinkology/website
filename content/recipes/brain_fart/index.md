description: "Brain Fart is a chaotic, high-proof concoction belonging to the college party punch family.  Originating in the late 20th century, it's a testament to the ingenuity (or perhaps desperation) of students seeking potent, readily available ingredients for a cheap, memorable (though perhaps not in a good way) experience.
