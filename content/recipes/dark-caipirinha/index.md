bartender_tips: 'Use a muddler with a heavy base to crush the lime and sugar, ensuring
  even extraction of oils. Don''t over-muddle, you want a coarse texture, not a paste.  Chill
  the cachaca beforehand for a crisp, refreshing drink.  Adjust the sugar to your
  preference - Demerara''s molasses notes work well with the cachaca, so err on the
  sweeter side.  Garnish with a lime wheel for an aromatic touch. '
