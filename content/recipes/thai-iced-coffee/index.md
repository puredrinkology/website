bartender_tips: "For a killer Thai Iced Coffee, use strong, freshly brewed coffee.\
  \ Don't skimp on the sugar \u2013 it should be sweet!  Dissolve the sugar in hot\
  \ coffee for a silky texture.  Use heavy cream, not milk, for richness.  Toast the\
  \ cardamom pods before grinding \u2013 it releases the aroma and adds a warm complexity.\
  \  Serve over ice with a splash of cream on top for an extra touch. "

visual: '## LLM Prompt: Describe the visual appeal of a Thai Iced Coffee. Imagine
  a tall glass filled with the beverage. Consider the following elements:* **Color:**
  What shades of brown and cream are present? How does the color gradient look?* **Texture:**
  Is the surface smooth or frothy? Are there any visible layers or swirls? * **Clarity:**
  Is the coffee clear or opaque? Does it have any visible particles? * **Garnish:**
  Is there any garnish on top? How does it affect the overall visual impression? **Example:**
  The Thai Iced Coffee sits in a tall glass, showcasing a deep, rich brown hue at
  the bottom, gradually transitioning to a lighter, milky cream at the top. The surface
  is topped with a delicate layer of froth, subtly swirling with the coffee underneath.
  The coffee itself is slightly opaque, hinting at the cardamom spice within. A sprig
  of mint adds a touch of freshness and vibrant green to the composition. '
