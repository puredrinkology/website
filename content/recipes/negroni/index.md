description: "The Negroni is a classic Italian bitter aperitivo, belonging to the Americano family of cocktails.  Born in Florence in 1919, it's named after Count Camillo Negroni, who requested a stronger version of the Americano by replacing the soda water with gin. "
flavor_description: "The Negroni is a bold, bitter cocktail with a balanced complexity. Gin's juniper and citrus notes meet Campari's bitter orange and herbal flavors, while sweet vermouth adds a touch of sweetness and a hint of spice. The overall taste is dry, slightly sweet, and intensely bittersweet, with a long, lingering finish. "
bartender_tips: "**Negroni Tips:*** **Use quality ingredients:** A good Negroni starts with good gin, Campari, and sweet vermouth.* **Equal parts:** The classic Negroni uses equal parts of each ingredient.* **Stir, don't shake:** Shaking will dilute the drink.* **Chill the glass:** A chilled glass will keep the drink cold.* **Garnish with an orange peel:** The orange peel adds a citrusy aroma and flavor."
