bartender_tips: 'When crafting the 9 1/2 Weeks, prioritize fresh, quality ingredients.
  Chill your Absolut Citron and orange juice beforehand for a crisp, refreshing drink.
  Shake vigorously with ice to ensure proper dilution and a smooth texture. A delicate
  balance is key: use a light hand with the strawberry liqueur for a subtle sweetness,
  and adjust the curacao to your liking. Garnish with a strawberry slice or orange
  twist for a vibrant touch. '
