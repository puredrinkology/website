title: "Long Island Tea"
description: "The Long Island Iced Tea is a potent member of the highball family, known for its tall, mixed drink format. Originating in the 1970s, its creation is debated, but it's believed to have stemmed from Long Island, New York. "
flavor_description: "The Long Island Iced Tea is a potent, sweet, and citrusy punch in the mouth. The vodka provides a clean, neutral base, while the rum, gin, and tequila contribute their distinct characteristics. The lemon juice adds a bright, tart note, and the Coca-Cola rounds out the flavor with a touch of sweetness and carbonation. Be warned: this cocktail packs a serious punch due to its high alcohol content. "
bartender_tips: "This drink packs a punch, so use a light hand with the booze.  Don't skimp on the lemon juice, it helps balance the sweetness.  Shake it hard with ice to chill it properly.  Use good quality spirits for best results.  And lastly, remember, this is not a tea! "

visual: "##  LLM Prompt: **Imagine a tall, icy glass filled with a deep amber liquid.  The color is reminiscent of a sunset, with hints of golden orange and a touch of ruby red.  The drink is topped with a generous amount of crushed ice, creating a cloudy, frosted appearance. A thin, lemon wedge clings to the rim of the glass, its pale yellow contrasting with the dark drink.  Tiny bubbles of carbonation rise from the depths, creating a gentle fizz that  entices the senses. Describe this cocktail in detail, using vivid imagery and sensory details.** "
