fullname: "The Whitecap Margarita Cocktail"
shortname: "Whitecap Margarita"
description: "The Whitecap Margarita is a delightful twist on the classic Margarita, belonging to the Sour family. This creamy, tropical take emerged in the 1970s, likely born from the desire to create a more approachable, sweeter version of the traditional tequila cocktail. "
flavor_description: "The Whitecap Margarita is a creamy, tropical twist on the classic. The tequila provides a sharp, agave-forward base, while the cream of coconut adds a rich, sweet, and subtly nutty flavor. Lime juice balances the sweetness with a bright, citrusy tang, resulting in a refreshing and decadent cocktail with a smooth, velvety texture. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfectly frothy Whitecap Margarita, use high-quality tequila and fresh lime juice.  Shake with ice until super cold, then strain into a salt-rimmed glass. For a smooth, creamy texture, use a high-quality cream of coconut.  Don't over-shake, or it will become too foamy. Garnish with a lime wedge and enjoy the sweet, tropical, and slightly tart flavor. "

visual: "Imagine a cocktail that embodies the serenity of a white-capped wave crashing on a sandy beach.  **Describe the Whitecap Margarita in detail, focusing on its appearance. Consider the following:*** **Color:** Is it a vibrant, tropical hue, or more of a creamy white with subtle hints of color?* **Texture:** Is it smooth and velvety, or does it have a layered, distinct appearance?* **Garnish:** What type of garnish would enhance the visual appeal and complement the flavors of the cocktail?* **Glassware:** Does it sit elegantly in a classic margarita glass, or does it demand a more rustic vessel? Remember to evoke a sense of the beach and the coolness of the whitecap waves in your description. "
