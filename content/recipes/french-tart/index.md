bartender_tips: 'To make a perfect French Tart, ensure your grapefruit juice is freshly
  squeezed for the best flavor. Use a good quality elderflower liqueur for a floral
  aroma.  Don''t over-shake the cocktail, as it can become cloudy.  Finally, adjust
  the simple syrup to your desired sweetness level. '

flavor_description: 'The French Tart is a delightful blend of sweet and tart flavors.
  Vodka provides a clean canvas, while elderflower liqueur adds a floral sweetness.  Grapefruit
  juice brings a bright citrus tang, balanced by the lime juice''s sharper acidity.
  A touch of simple syrup rounds out the sweetness, creating a harmonious and refreshing
  cocktail with a bright, citrusy finish. '
