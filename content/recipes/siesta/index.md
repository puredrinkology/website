fullname: "The Siesta Cocktail"
shortname: "Siesta"
description: "The Siesta belongs to the **Sour** family, characterized by its tangy balance of citrus and spirit. Its origins are likely a modern creation, blending the bitter Campari and the sweetness of grapefruit with the robust Tequila, a unique spin on the classic sour template. "
flavor_description: "The Siesta is a vibrant and refreshing cocktail. Tequila's agave notes dance with Campari's bitter-sweetness, creating a complex base. Bright lime juice cuts through the sweetness, while grapefruit adds a touch of citrusy zest. The gum syrup provides a subtle sweetness that balances the overall flavors. The result is a sophisticated and balanced cocktail that's perfect for a warm afternoon. "
bartender_tips: "This cocktail, Siesta, is a refreshing, bittersweet concoction. To ensure optimal taste, use a high-quality tequila, preferably reposado. The Campari and grapefruit juice provide a balanced bitterness, so adjust their proportions to taste. Freshly squeezed lime juice is essential, and a touch of gum syrup helps round out the flavor. Shake well with ice, strain into a chilled coupe glass, and garnish with a grapefruit twist for an extra touch of citrus. "
