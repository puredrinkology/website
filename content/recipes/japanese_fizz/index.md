title: "The Japanese Fizz Cocktail"
fullname: "The Japanese Fizz Cocktail"
shortname: "Japanese Fizz"
description: "The Japanese Fizz belongs to the Sour family, a classic cocktail style featuring a base spirit, citrus juice, and a sweetener. Though its exact origins are unclear, its name suggests a Japanese influence, likely a variation on the classic Whiskey Sour, popularized in Japan during the 19th century. "
flavor_description: "The Japanese Fizz is a delightful blend of sweet and tart.  The blended whiskey provides a smooth, mellow base, while the lemon adds bright acidity.  Powdered sugar contributes a touch of sweetness, balanced by the dry, fruity notes of port.  The egg white adds a creamy texture and subtle richness, while the carbonated water creates a light and bubbly finish.  Overall, it's a refreshing and sophisticated cocktail with a unique depth of flavor. "
bartender_tips: "This drink is all about the silky texture.  When shaking, use a dry shake (without ice) to froth the egg white first, then add ice for a proper chill.  Don't over shake, it can get foamy.  Use a fine mesh strainer to ensure a clean, smooth texture.  A touch of bitters can add a nice depth of flavor.  "
