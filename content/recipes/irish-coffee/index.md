bartender_tips: 'Use freshly brewed coffee, preferably hot but not boiling.  Dissolve
  the sugar in the coffee before adding whiskey, as the sugar will melt better in
  hot coffee.  Pour whiskey over a back of a bar spoon to avoid disturbing the coffee.  Top
  with freshly whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg for a classic touch.  Don''t
  overfill the glass!  Enjoy! '

flavor_description: 'Irish Coffee is a comforting blend of warm, rich flavors. The
  smoky, smooth Irish whiskey mingles with the robust, bittersweet coffee, balanced
  by the sweetness of sugar.  A layer of pillowy whipped cream adds a touch of airy
  sweetness and a velvety texture, making each sip both satisfying and decadent. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of an Irish CoffeeImagine a tall glass
  filled with a dark, rich liquid that resembles a freshly brewed cup of coffee. The
  surface of the liquid is crowned with a generous dollop of fluffy, snow-white whipped
  cream, forming a perfect, pillowy cap. The cream is tinged with a subtle golden
  hue, hinting at the whiskey hidden beneath.  A gentle swirl of the liquid reveals
  hints of caramel brown, a testament to the sweetness of the sugar that balances
  the bitterness of the coffee. The glass itself is often a classic Irish coffee mug,
  made of sturdy glass and designed to keep the warmth of the drink. Describe the
  visual appeal of this iconic cocktail, focusing on the color, texture, and overall
  appearance. '
