bartender_tips: 'Use high-quality cold brew for the best flavor. Shake vigorously
  with ice to chill and emulsify the cocktail.  Don''t over-shake, as it can dilute
  the coffee.  Strain into a chilled martini glass for a perfect presentation.  A
  sprinkle of coffee beans or a thin slice of orange peel adds a touch of elegance. '

flavor_description: 'The Mr Black Espresso Martini is a symphony of bold flavors.
  The Mr Black coffee liqueur brings a rich, roasted coffee taste with hints of chocolate
  and vanilla.  The vodka adds a smooth, clean alcohol base, while the cold brew coffee
  contributes a robust, slightly bitter edge.  This cocktail is a perfect blend of
  sweet, bitter, and boozy, leaving a long, lingering coffee finish. '

  a sleek, black cocktail glass, chilled to perfection. Inside, the drink swirls with
