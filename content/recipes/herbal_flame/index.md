flavor_description: "Herbal Flame bursts with spicy warmth from the Hot Damn, Tea base. Ginger and cinnamon dance on your tongue, with a lingering heat that morphs into a cool, refreshing finish. The herbal notes of chamomile and mint add a soothing complexity, creating a truly unique and balanced cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "When crafting the Herbal Flame, remember that the Hot Damn, Tea is the star. Use a high-quality, strong brew for maximum flavor. Muddle the mint gently to release oils without bruising the leaves. Shake vigorously with ice to chill the cocktail thoroughly and create a frothy top. Garnish with a sprig of mint and a splash of sparkling water for an extra touch.  "
