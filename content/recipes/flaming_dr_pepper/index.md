visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the Flaming Dr. Pepper Cocktail**Imagine a tall, frosted glass filled with a vibrant, dark amber liquid. The drink has a layered appearance, with a deep reddish-brown bottom, a hazy, golden middle layer, and a frothy, cola-colored head. The head is speckled with tiny bubbles that burst and fizz, releasing a faint aroma of caramel and rum.****A thin layer of flame dances atop the frothy head, casting a warm glow on the glass. The flames flicker, creating a mesmerizing visual display that adds to the drink's mystique and allure. The glass is adorned with condensation, a testament to the cocktail's potent nature.****In the background, you can see a dim bar setting, with dimly lit lamps casting shadows around the glass, enhancing the dramatic effect of the flames. The glass rests on a coaster, next to a shaker with ice and a bottle of Dr. Pepper, adding to the visual narrative of the drink's composition.****Write a vivid description of the Flaming Dr. Pepper cocktail, focusing on its colors, textures, and overall aesthetic appeal. Use sensory details to capture the viewer's imagination and create a sense of excitement and intrigue around this unique concoction.** "
