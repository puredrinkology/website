description: "The Lassi - Sweet isn't technically a cocktail, but a traditional Indian beverage. It belongs to the **Milk Punch** family, characterized by its milky base and refreshing nature. Originating in the Indian subcontinent, the Lassi is a centuries-old drink enjoyed for its cooling and hydrating properties. "
flavor_description: "This Lassi - Sweet is a creamy and refreshing drink with a balanced sweet-tart flavor. The yoghurt provides a smooth, tangy base that's tempered by the sweetness of sugar and a hint of salt.  Lemon juice adds a bright acidity that cuts through the richness, leaving a clean, invigorating finish. It's like a luxurious, chilled yogurt drink with a touch of zest. "
bartender_tips: "For a smooth and refreshing Lassi, use good quality, thick yogurt. Blend it with water, sugar, and salt until perfectly smooth, then add lemon juice at the end for a bright zing.  Don't overblend, or you'll end up with a thin, watery lassi. Adjust sweetness and salt to taste. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of a Lassi - Sweet cocktail. Imagine a glass filled with this drink. What are the colors, textures, and overall visual impression?** **Consider these ingredients:*** **Yoghurt:** Creamy, white, possibly with slight variations in shade depending on the type of yoghurt used.* **Water:** Transparent, clear, contributing to the overall fluidity of the drink.* **Sugar:** Dissolves in the drink, adding a subtle sweetness but not changing the visual appearance significantly. * **Salt:** A minimal amount, invisible to the naked eye.* **Lemon Juice:** Adds a slight yellowish hue and may create a thin layer of foam on top. **Focus on:*** The overall color and its intensity.* The consistency of the drink â€“ is it thick, smooth, or watery? * Are there any layers or separation visible in the glass? * Does the drink have any shine or sparkle?* Is there any foam or froth present? **Write your description in a descriptive and evocative way.** "
