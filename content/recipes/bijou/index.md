shortname: "Bijou"
description: "The Bijou is a captivating member of the **aromatic, herbal-forward cocktail family** reminiscent of the classic French 75. Its roots likely lie in the **early 20th century**, born amidst the golden age of cocktails, where Chartreuse's unique botanicals were embraced for their complexity. "
flavor_description: "The Bijou is a complex and intriguing cocktail. The gin's juniper notes are balanced by the herbal sweetness of the green Chartreuse, with a subtle bitterness from the orange bitters. The sweet vermouth adds a touch of richness and complexity, creating a layered and nuanced flavor profile. The overall experience is a harmonious blend of botanicals, spice, and sweetness, with a lingering finish that is both refreshing and satisfying. "
bartender_tips: "The Bijou's elegance lies in its balance.  Use a good quality gin and a reputable Green Chartreuse.  Start with a small amount of bitters, adding more to taste.  Stir the drink with ice to chill thoroughly, then strain into a chilled coupe.  A lemon twist garnish adds a refreshing touch.  Don't over-muddle the bitters, as it can make the drink bitter. "
