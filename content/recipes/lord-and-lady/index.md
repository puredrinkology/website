bartender_tips: 'The Lord and Lady is a classic, easy-to-make cocktail.  To ensure
  a smooth and balanced flavor, use high-quality dark rum and Tia Maria.  Start with
  a well-chilled glass for a refreshing drink.  Don''t over-shake; you want a velvety
  texture, not a frothy one.  Finally, garnish with a coffee bean or chocolate curl
  for an elegant touch. '
