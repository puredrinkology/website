description: "The Yellow Bird is a vibrant, citrus-forward cocktail belonging to the Sour family.  Born in the 1970s, it's a playful twist on the Daiquiri, substituting rum with a blend of Galliano and Triple Sec for a uniquely sweet and herbal character. "
flavor_description: "The Yellow Bird is a tropical delight with a vibrant, citrus-forward taste. The white rum provides a clean, crisp base, while the Galliano adds a unique herbal and anise-like sweetness. Triple Sec balances the sweetness with a hint of orange, while lime juice provides a refreshing acidity that cuts through the richness. Overall, it's a smooth, well-balanced cocktail with a complex and refreshing flavor profile. "
bartender_tips: "For a vibrant Yellow Bird, use fresh lime juice for optimal tang. Shake vigorously with ice to chill thoroughly. Strain into a chilled coupe or martini glass for a refreshing presentation. A light, frothy head adds to the visual appeal. Garnish with a lime wheel or a twist for a final touch. "
