description: "The Boston Sour belongs to the Sour family of cocktails, characterized by their acidic, sweet, and often frothy texture.  Originating in the late 19th century, likely in Boston, this drink combines the sharp tang of lemon with the sweetness of sugar and the richness of whiskey, creating a balanced and refreshing cocktail. "
flavor_description: "The Boston Sour is a delightful blend of tart and sweet. The blended whiskey provides a smooth, warm base, balanced by the tangy lemon juice and subtle sweetness of the powdered sugar. The egg white adds a creamy texture and light froth, while the cherry garnish offers a touch of fruity acidity. It's a refreshing and well-rounded cocktail, perfect for sipping on a warm evening. "
bartender_tips: "Use a dry shake first, without ice, to emulsify the egg white for a foamy head. Add ice for the second shake, ensuring a well-chilled, smooth drink. Use a good quality blended whiskey for a balanced flavor.  Strain the cocktail through a fine-mesh strainer to remove any ice chips or egg white bits. Garnish with a cherry or lemon twist for a classic touch. "
