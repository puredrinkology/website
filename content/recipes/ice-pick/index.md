bartender_tips: 'This one''s all about balance. Use a good quality vodka and fresh
  lemon juice for the best flavor.  Don''t overpower the tea with too much lemon.
  Start with a 1:1 ratio of iced tea to vodka, then add lemon juice to taste.  Shake
  with ice for a frosty, refreshing drink. If you''re feeling fancy, rim the glass
  with sugar before pouring. '

flavor_description: 'The Ice Pick is a refreshing, tangy cocktail with a clean, crisp
  finish. The vodka provides a smooth base, while the iced tea lends a subtle sweetness
  and earthy notes. Lemon juice brightens the profile, adding a tartness that balances
  the sweetness and adds a hint of citrus. The overall effect is a light, refreshing
  drink that''s perfect for a warm day. '
