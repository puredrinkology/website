description: "A1 belongs to the Sour family, a classic cocktail style characterized by its tart, balanced flavors. Though its exact origins are unclear, it likely emerged in the early 20th century, drawing inspiration from the iconic Whiskey Sour and its numerous variations. "
flavor_description: "A1 delivers a vibrant and complex flavor profile. The gin provides a crisp, juniper-forward base, while Grand Marnier contributes a rich orange sweetness.  Tart lemon juice balances the sweetness and adds a refreshing acidity, while a touch of grenadine rounds out the drink with a subtle, fruity sweetness and a touch of tartness.  The overall experience is a harmonious blend of citrus, spice, and sweetness, creating a delightful and balanced cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "This sounds like a variation on a classic, so finesse is key!  Shake hard with ice to chill thoroughly, and strain into a chilled coupe.  Don't overdo the grenadine - a few drops add a beautiful color gradient and tartness.  A citrus twist for garnish is lovely, but a maraschino cherry adds a touch of whimsy. "
