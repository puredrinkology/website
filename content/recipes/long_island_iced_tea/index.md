shortname: "Long Island Iced Tea"
description: "The Long Island Iced Tea is a potent highball cocktail, born in the 1970s on Long Island, New York. This strong, multi-spirit drink, often mistaken for tea due to its dark color, is classified as a highball due to its base of cola and spirit ratios. "
flavor_description: "The Long Island Iced Tea is a deceptive drink. It's sweet and refreshing, with the Coca-Cola dominating the initial taste. But beneath that, there's a potent kick of alcohol from the vodka, tequila, rum, and gin, creating a complex and surprisingly strong punch. The lemon peel adds a subtle citrus note that balances the sweetness and bitterness, leaving you with a lingering warmth and a sense of happy confusion. "
bartender_tips: "The key to a great Long Island Iced Tea is balance.  Use equal parts of each spirit, around 1/2oz each.  Avoid over-pouring the Coca-Cola - it should just top the drink. A good quality lemon peel will make a difference, so use a fresh one and express the oils over the drink before dropping it in.  Don't forget the ice! It's a powerful drink, so enjoy responsibly. "

The top of the drink is adorned with a thin slice of lemon peel, its yellow rind contrasting beautifully with the dark depths of the cocktail. Describe the drink's appearance in detail, paying attention to the color, texture, and any other visual elements that make it enticing. "
