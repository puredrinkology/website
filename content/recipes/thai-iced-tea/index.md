bartender_tips: For a perfect Thai Iced Tea, brew strong black tea, let it cool completely,
  and sweeten with condensed milk to your liking.  Don't rush the chilling -  a long,
  slow chill brings out the best flavor.  Muddle fresh mint for a fragrant garnish,
  or add a sprig to the glass for a refreshing aroma.  A splash of lime juice adds
  a touch of tartness, but use sparingly!

visual: '## LLM Prompt:Imagine a tall glass filled with a vibrant orange liquid, the
  color of a fiery sunset. Tiny ice cubes clink gently against the glass, creating
  a mesmerizing symphony of sound. The surface of the liquid is adorned with a delicate
  layer of foamy cream, reminiscent of a fluffy cloud. A few sprigs of fresh mint,
  their green leaves contrasting beautifully with the orange backdrop, add a touch
  of elegance and a hint of their refreshing aroma. This is **Thai Iced Tea**, a visually
  stunning cocktail that embodies the essence of Thailand''s vibrant culture and flavors.
  Describe this scene in vivid detail, capturing the nuances of color, texture, and
  aroma. '
