bartender_tips: "This sounds like a fun, but potentially challenging combination!\
  \  Here's the key: **temperature**. The Midori needs to be cold, so chill it in\
  \ advance.  The J\xE4germeister and Goldschlager will be best served very cold too,\
  \ so use a chilled mixing glass.  This will ensure the flavors blend properly and\
  \ don't become overly strong.  Also, a good shake is essential to bring out the\
  \ full potential of the cocktail. "

  \ and Goldschlager, is a unique concoction that defies easy categorization. While\
  \ it exhibits elements of the shooter family with its potent and layered flavors,\
  \ its origin remains shrouded in mystery.  "

flavor_description: "The Bob Marley is a sweet and spicy adventure.  Midori's vibrant\
  \ melon sweetness takes center stage, with J\xE4germeister adding a warming herbal\
  \ kick and a touch of bitterness.  Goldschlager's cinnamon and gold flake provide\
  \ a lingering, warming spice that balances the overall sweetness.  The result is\
  \ a unique cocktail that's both refreshing and surprisingly complex. "
