description: "The Pimm's Cup belongs to the **Gin & Tonic family**, a group of refreshing, spirit-based drinks. Its origins lie in **19th century England**, where the Pimm's brothers created a gin-based liqueur specifically designed for mixing with lemonade and fruit. "
flavor_description: "The Pimms Cup is a refreshingly tart and slightly sweet cocktail with a vibrant citrus flavor. Pimms No. 1's gin base provides a subtle juniper backbone, while the lemonade offers a tangy sweetness. The mint adds a cool, herbal note, and the orange and strawberry slices provide a burst of fruity sweetness. The cucumber adds a crisp, refreshing element, balancing the overall sweetness.  "
bartender_tips: "Use fresh, muddled mint and cucumber for the best flavor. Don't over-muddle, just bruise the ingredients to release their oils.  Let the Pimms sit in the glass with the other ingredients for at least 5 minutes to chill and meld flavors.  Top with a generous pour of lemonade, adjusting to your taste.  Don't forget the garnishes - a sprig of mint, a strawberry and a cucumber ribbon add visual appeal and freshness. "
