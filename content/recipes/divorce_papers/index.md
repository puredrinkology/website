flavor_description: "The Divorce Papers is a bittersweet symphony on the palate. The vibrant passionfruit syrup dances with the crisp gin and tart lemon, creating a bright and refreshing base. Aperol adds a touch of bitter orange and herbal complexity, while the honey rounds out the finish with a subtle sweetness. It's a cocktail that is both bold and balanced, leaving a lasting impression of tropical sunshine and elegant bitterness. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Divorce Papers, start by shaking your passionfruit syrup and gin with ice. This ensures the syrup blends properly. Then, add the remaining ingredients and shake again.
