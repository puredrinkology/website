bartender_tips: "Muddle the lime aggressively to release the oils, don't be shy! \
  \ A good muddle is key to a balanced Caipirinha.  Use a high-quality cacha\xE7a\
  \ for best results.  A little bit of elderflower cordial goes a long way, so start\
  \ with a small amount and adjust to your liking.  Serve it chilled and garnish with\
  \ a lime wedge.  Cheers! "

title: The Elderflower Caipirinha Cocktail
visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of an Elderflower Caipirinha. Imagine\
  \ a glass filled with crushed ice, a splash of lime juice, a subtle swirl of elderflower\
  \ cordial, and a generous pour of Cacha\xE7a. Consider the color, clarity, and texture\
  \ of the drink. Include details like how the ice interacts with the liquid, the\
  \ appearance of the lime, and any potential garnish.** **Example Response:**The\
  \ Elderflower Caipirinha is a vibrant and inviting drink. The crushed ice in the\
  \ glass is a pristine white, its surface barely disturbed by the shimmering liquid.\
  \ The Cacha\xE7a, a clear spirit, forms a base for the drink, its color slightly\
  \ tinted by the bright, chartreuse green of the elderflower cordial. A wedge of\
  \ lime, its skin a deep, glossy green, rests on the rim of the glass, releasing\
  \ its citrusy aroma into the air. The texture is refreshing and lively, with the\
  \ crushed ice giving way to the smooth, cool liquid. It's a cocktail that captivates\
  \ both the eyes and the palate. "
