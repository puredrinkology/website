flavor_description: "The Addison, with its gin and vermouth base, offers a sophisticated and refreshing taste. The botanicals of the gin shine through, creating a bright and complex flavor profile with notes of juniper, citrus, and spice. The vermouth adds a touch of dryness and herbal complexity, balancing the gin's boldness. The result is a well-rounded cocktail that is both invigorating and elegant. "
bartender_tips: "The Addison is a classic Gin Martini, so focus on the gin!  Choose a quality gin with distinct botanicals for a complex flavor profile.  Chill your glass and gin for a crisp experience.  Use a good vermouth for depth, but don't overdo it.  Stir gently to avoid diluting, and garnish with a lemon twist for a touch of citrus. "
