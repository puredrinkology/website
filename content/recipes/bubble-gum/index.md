bartender_tips: 'For a perfectly balanced Bubble Gum, use a good quality vodka and
  a banana liqueur that''s not too sweet.  Freshly squeezed orange juice is key, but
  don''t overdo it.  Start with a small amount of peach schnapps and adjust to taste.  Shake
  with ice until chilled and strain into a chilled glass. A rim of sugar or orange
  zest adds a nice touch. '
