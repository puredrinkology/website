bartender_tips: 'A Pink Lady is all about balance.  Use a good quality gin and apple
  brandy.  Shake hard with ice to chill thoroughly.  The grenadine adds sweetness,
  so adjust the amount to your liking.  A fresh squeeze of lemon juice is key, so
  don''t skip it.  Strain into a chilled coupe glass and garnish with a cherry. '
