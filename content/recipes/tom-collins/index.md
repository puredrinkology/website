bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Tom Collins, use a good quality gin and fresh lemon
  juice.  Make sure to shake the gin, lemon juice, and sugar with ice to thoroughly
  chill the drink.  Don''t over-shake, though - you want it to be well-mixed, not
  foamy.  Top with club soda and garnish with a maraschino cherry and an orange slice.
  This will ensure the drink is balanced and refreshing. '

title: The Tom Collins Cocktail
visual: '##  LLM Prompt: **Imagine a tall, elegant glass filled with ice and a shimmering,
  effervescent liquid. The drink is a pale, crystalline shade of yellow, almost like
  a lemon sorbet, with tiny bubbles dancing on the surface. A bright, juicy lemon
  slice rests on the rim, alongside a plump, ruby red maraschino cherry, suspended
  on a decorative toothpick. The aroma is invigorating, with a crisp, citrusy note
  that blends beautifully with the subtle sweetness of the sugar and the refreshing
  essence of gin. Describe this cocktail, capturing its visual appeal and the sensory
  experience it evokes.** '
