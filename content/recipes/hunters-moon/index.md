bartender_tips: 'For a balanced Hunter''s Moon, use a dry vermouth for a crisp bite.
  Muddle the blackberries gently to release their flavor without making it too bitter.  Chill
  your lemonade thoroughly and use a good quality sugar syrup to ensure sweetness
  without cloying. Garnish with a fresh blackberry and a maraschino cherry for a beautiful
  presentation. '
