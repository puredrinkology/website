description: "The Sourise is a contemporary cocktail, likely influenced by the Sour family, which features citrus and a spirit base.  Its use of raspberry gum syrup and orgeat suggests a modern twist on classic sour flavors.  Exact origins are unknown, but the combination points to a recent, creative invention. "
flavor_description: "The Sourise is a complex and layered cocktail with a vibrant, tart sweetness. The raspberry gum syrup provides a bright fruitiness that dances with the floral notes of the orgeat. The vodka and cognac contribute a smooth, warming backbone, balanced by the tartness of the lemon juice. The gum syrup adds a subtle, textural richness. The result is a well-rounded cocktail that's both refreshing and sophisticated. "
bartender_tips: "When making the Sourise, prioritize fresh ingredients. Use a good quality cognac for depth and raspberry gum syrup for sweetness.  Don't be afraid to adjust the lemon juice to your liking. Shake vigorously with ice to chill and emulsify the flavors. Double-strain to remove any ice shards or gum syrup chunks. Finally, garnish with a lemon twist for a refreshing touch. "
