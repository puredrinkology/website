fullname: "The Broadside Cocktail"
shortname: "Broadside"
description: "The Broadside, with its potent rum and scotch base,  belongs to the robust world of **highball cocktails**.  Its origins likely stem from the 19th century, reflecting the era's fascination with strong spirits and bold flavors. The use of wormwood, a key ingredient in absinthe, hints at the cocktail's connection to the historical death in the afternoon era. "
flavor_description: "The Broadside is a complex and potent cocktail. The 151 Proof rum delivers a fiery, boozy kick, while the Scotch adds smoky depth. The bitters lend a bitter, herbaceous touch, while the wormwood introduces an earthy, almost medicinal note. The ice chills the drink, tempering the heat and highlighting the individual flavors. Overall, the Broadside is a bold, daring drink with a lingering finish that leaves you wanting more. "
bartender_tips: "The Broadside is a firecracker of a cocktail, so handle the 151 proof rum with respect.  Chill your glassware for a truly icy experience.  Use a good quality Scotch, as it will be the backbone of the drink.  A dash of Angostura bitters will add a spicy kick, and absinthe will provide a subtle, herbaceous aroma.  Remember, less is more with the wormwood.  Build the drink over ice, stir gently, and garnish with a lemon twist.  Enjoy responsibly! "
