bartender_tips: 'Use a good quality gin and a vermouth that''s not overly sweet.  Chill
  your glass beforehand and stir the drink with ice to ensure a perfectly chilled
  cocktail. Don''t over-stir or the gin will become cloudy. Garnish with a lemon twist
  for a citrusy aroma and a final touch of elegance. '

flavor_description: 'The Lone Tree Cocktail offers a balanced and complex taste profile.
  The sweet vermouth provides a rich, slightly bitter base with notes of dried fruits
  and herbs, while the gin adds a crisp, juniper-forward character. The interplay
  of these elements creates a harmonious blend of sweetness, bitterness, and herbal
  complexity. The cocktail finishes with a lingering dryness, leaving a pleasant warmth
  on the palate. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt for Describing the Lone Tree Cocktail**Prompt:**Imagine a single,
  elegant cocktail glass filled with a beautiful amber liquid. The color is a rich,
  deep hue, reminiscent of the warm glow of a setting sun. Tiny, shimmering bubbles
  rise slowly from the depths, creating a delicate, ethereal aura. The aroma is complex
  and intriguing, with hints of bittersweet vermouth and a subtle, earthy note of
  juniper from the gin. As you lift the glass to your lips, you notice a faint, almost
  imperceptible, oily film clinging to the rim, hinting at the smooth, velvety texture
  that awaits. **Describe the appearance of this cocktail in detail, focusing on its
  color, texture, and any visible elements like bubbles or a rim. Use evocative language
  and imagery to paint a picture in the reader''s mind.** '
