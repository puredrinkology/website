The bourbon, mezcal, and Cynar add smoky, herbal, and bittersweet notes, while the peach liqueur and lemon juice provide a balance of sweetness and acidity. "
flavor_description: "The Kentucky Mai Tai is a complex and intriguing cocktail. The bourbon and mezcal provide a smoky, spicy base, while the orgeat and peach liqueur add sweetness and floral notes. Cynar's artichoke bitterness balances the sweetness, and the lemon juice provides a refreshing acidity. Expect a layered experience with notes of smoke, spice, fruit, and a subtle vegetal undertone. "
bartender_tips: "This is a unique twist on a classic! When building the Kentucky Mai Tai, focus on quality ingredients. Freshly squeezed lemon juice is essential.  Use a good quality mezcal that has a smoky character. The Cynar adds a complex, bitter note that balances the sweetness of the orgeat and peach liqueur.  Shake with ice to chill, but strain into a chilled coupe glass to prevent dilution. Enjoy the surprising complexity! "

Consider the following ingredients and their potential visual impact:*** **Orgeat:** A milky white syrup that can add a slight cloudiness.* **Bourbon:** Amber to golden brown, can be light or dark depending on the specific bourbon used.* **Mezcal:** A smoky, amber-colored spirit that may add a hint of opacity.* **Cynar:** A bitter, dark-brown liqueur that can add a deep color to the drink.* **Peach Liqueur:** A clear, pale yellow liqueur that may add a slight blush to the cocktail.* **Lemon Juice:** Adds a vibrant citrus hue and can create a slight foam on top.**Consider the overall color, clarity, and texture of the drink. Does it have a layered look? Is there any foam or froth? Does the color vary depending on the light?** **Example:**The Kentucky Mai Tai is a mesmerizing blend of colors, ranging from deep amber to a vibrant citrus yellow.  The drink is slightly cloudy due to the orgeat, with a hint of smoky opacity from the mezcal.  The Cynar adds a layer of dark brown depth, while the peach liqueur gives the drink a subtle blush.  A light layer of froth forms on top, adding a touch of texture and highlighting the citrusy notes. The overall effect is a captivating amber cocktail, with a subtle complexity in its hues and a playful interplay of light and shadow. "
