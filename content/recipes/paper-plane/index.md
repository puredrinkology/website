bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Paper Plane, use a good quality bourbon and a balanced
  amaro like Averna or Montenegro.  Shake well with ice to ensure proper dilution
  and chilling.  Use fresh lemon juice, not bottled, and make sure the Aperol is cold,
  too. Strain into a chilled coupe glass for a crisp, refreshing drink. '

description: 'The Paper Plane, a harmonious blend of bourbon, amaro, Aperol, and lemon
  juice, belongs to the sour family of cocktails.  This modern classic, created by
  Sam Ross in 2007, is a riff on the classic Whiskey Sour, featuring the bitter complexity
  of amaro and Aperol. '
family: sour
flavor_description: 'The Paper Plane is a bright and bittersweet cocktail. The bourbon
  provides a warm, oaky base, while the Amaro adds herbal and bitter notes. Aperol
  contributes a vibrant orange flavor and a touch of sweetness, perfectly balanced
  by the tartness of fresh lemon juice. The result is a refreshing and complex drink
  with a long, lingering finish. '
