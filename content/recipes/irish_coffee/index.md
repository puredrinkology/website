description: "Irish Coffee, a member of the **Coffee Cocktail** family, was born in the 1940s at Foynes Flying Boat Base in Ireland. It's a warm and comforting blend of Irish whiskey, hot coffee, sugar, and a fluffy crown of whipped cream. "
flavor_description: "Irish Coffee is a comforting blend of warm, rich flavors. The smoky, smooth Irish whiskey mingles with the robust, bittersweet coffee, balanced by the sweetness of sugar.  A layer of pillowy whipped cream adds a touch of airy sweetness and a velvety texture, making each sip both satisfying and decadent. "
bartender_tips: "Use freshly brewed coffee, preferably hot but not boiling.  Dissolve the sugar in the coffee before adding whiskey, as the sugar will melt better in hot coffee.  Pour whiskey over a back of a bar spoon to avoid disturbing the coffee.  Top with freshly whipped cream and a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg for a classic touch.  Don't overfill the glass!  Enjoy! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of an Irish CoffeeImagine a tall glass filled with a dark, rich liquid that resembles a freshly brewed cup of coffee. The surface of the liquid is crowned with a generous dollop of fluffy, snow-white whipped cream, forming a perfect, pillowy cap. The cream is tinged with a subtle golden hue, hinting at the whiskey hidden beneath.  A gentle swirl of the liquid reveals hints of caramel brown, a testament to the sweetness of the sugar that balances the bitterness of the coffee. The glass itself is often a classic Irish coffee mug, made of sturdy glass and designed to keep the warmth of the drink. Describe the visual appeal of this iconic cocktail, focusing on the color, texture, and overall appearance. "
