title: "Adam"
description: "The Adam belongs to the Sour family, a classic cocktail group characterized by the base spirit, citrus juice, and sweetener. Its origins remain obscure, but likely emerged in the early 20th century, possibly in the Caribbean where rum, lemons, and grenadine were readily available. "
flavor_description: "Adam is a balanced, bittersweet cocktail with a vibrant citrus kick. The dark rum provides a rich, spiced base, mellowed by the tart lemon juice. A touch of sweetness from grenadine adds a subtle depth, while the interplay of these flavors evokes a tropical sunset. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Adam, use a good quality dark rum and fresh lemon juice.  Don't skimp on the grenadine, it adds the sweetness and vibrant color.  Shake well with ice to chill and dilute.  Strain into a chilled coupe glass and garnish with a lemon twist or a cherry.  Enjoy! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of the cocktail Adam, made with Dark Rum, Lemon Juice, and Grenadine. **Focus on the following details:*** **Color:** Is it a single, uniform color, or layered?  If layered, describe the colors and their order from top to bottom.* **Texture:** Is it clear or cloudy?  Does it have any visible particles, like ice?* **Garnish:** Does it have a garnish? If so, describe its appearance and how it is placed in the drink.* **Glassware:** What kind of glass is it served in?  Describe its shape and size. **Example Response:**The Adam is a layered cocktail, with a vibrant, almost fluorescent red layer of grenadine at the bottom, topped by a darker amber layer of the rum, and a thin, opaque white layer of lemon juice on top. The drink is cloudy due to the ice, which is visible in small, fractured pieces at the bottom. It is served in a chilled coupe glass, its rounded shape showcasing the beautiful layering effect. A single lemon twist is gently placed on the rim of the glass, adding a touch of freshness to the visually appealing cocktail. "
