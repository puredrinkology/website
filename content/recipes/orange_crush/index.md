description: "The Orange Crush is a classic highball, a family of cocktails typically served in a tall glass with ice and a mixer.  Its origins are likely rooted in the early 20th century, a time when simple, refreshing drinks gained popularity. "
flavor_description: "The Orange Crush is a vibrant and refreshing cocktail with a sweet and tangy flavor profile. The vodka provides a clean, neutral base, while the triple sec adds a touch of orange zest and a slight bitterness. The orange juice dominates the taste with its bright citrus sweetness, creating a well-balanced and enjoyable drink that's perfect for a warm day. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Orange Crush, use a good quality vodka and fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Shake vigorously with ice to ensure a well-chilled, frothy drink.  Don't skimp on the Triple Sec, it adds the necessary sweetness and orange flavor.  Garnish with a fresh orange slice or wheel for a touch of elegance.  Remember, a balanced Orange Crush is a beautiful thing! "
