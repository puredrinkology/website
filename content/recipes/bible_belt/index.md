title: "Bible Belt"
description: "The Bible Belt is a classic sour cocktail, a family known for their tangy, citrusy profiles. It's likely a Southern invention, blending the warmth of Southern Comfort with the sweetness of Triple Sec and lime, creating a refreshing drink perfect for the region's climate. "
flavor_description: "The Bible Belt is a sweet and tart cocktail with a smooth, balanced flavor. Southern Comfort's spiced whiskey notes mingle with the citrusy tang of Triple Sec and lime, while the sour mix adds a touch of acidity.  The result is a refreshing and easy-drinking cocktail, perfect for those who enjoy a hint of Southern charm in their drinks. "
bartender_tips: "To make a killer Bible Belt, start with fresh lime juice â€“ bottled is a no-go. Use good quality sour mix, not the overly sweet kind.  Shake hard with ice to chill the cocktail properly.  Don't over-pour the Triple Sec, it should complement, not dominate.  A splash of soda water can give it a nice fizz. Garnish with a lime wheel, and enjoy! "
