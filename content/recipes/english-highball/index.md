  beforehand. Use high-quality brandy and gin, and a touch of sweet vermouth for complexity.

description: 'The English Highball is a unique blend of spirits and fizz, defying
  easy categorization. Though its ingredients hint at a classic highball, its brandy
  and vermouth base lean towards a Manhattan-like complexity. Its origin is shrouded
  in mystery, likely emerging from the eclectic cocktail scene of late 19th century
  England. '

flavor_description: 'The English Highball offers a complex, layered flavor profile.
  The brandy provides rich fruitiness and warmth, while gin adds a botanical spice.
  Sweet vermouth contributes sweetness and herbal notes, balanced by the refreshing
  effervescence of carbonated water. A subtle citrus zest from the lemon peel completes
  the experience, creating a harmonious blend of sweet, spicy, and invigorating notes. '
