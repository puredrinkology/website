bartender_tips: 'Use a strong, freshly brewed coffee for the best flavor.  Chill the
  Grand Marnier beforehand to ensure a balanced, refreshing cocktail.  Use a good
  quality ice and a cocktail shaker for optimal dilution and chilling.  Strain into
  a chilled coupe glass for a sophisticated presentation.  A splash of orange bitters
  can add complexity. '
