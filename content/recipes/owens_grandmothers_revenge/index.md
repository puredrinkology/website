shortname: "Owens Grandmors Revenge"
description: "Owen's Grandmother's Revenge belongs to the Highball family, a refreshing blend of spirits and mixers. While its precise origin is unknown, the combination of whiskey, beer, and lemonade likely arose from the practice of highballing â€“ using soda water to dilute strong spirits, popularized in the early 20th century. "
flavor_description: "Owen's Grandmother's Revenge offers a complex, layered flavor profile.  The whiskey's warmth and spice mingle with the crispness of beer and the tart sweetness of lemonade.  The ice chills the drink, creating a refreshing, balanced experience.  The combination is both bold and approachable, with a surprising twist that lingers on the palate. "
bartender_tips: "Start with a good quality whiskey, it's the star of the show. Use a beer that complements the whiskey, a pale ale or IPA work well. Freshly squeezed lemonade adds brightness, so don't be shy with the citrus.  Use a tall glass filled with ice to keep the drink chilled, and don't over-mix - you want a layered, balanced cocktail, not a beer-slushy.  Enjoy! "
