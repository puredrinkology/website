bartender_tips: 'For a smooth coffee liqueur, use freshly brewed, strong coffee. Steep
  the coffee grounds for a slightly longer time than usual for a more concentrated
  flavor. A high-quality vodka will yield a cleaner taste. Vanilla extract enhances
  the coffee aroma, so use a good quality one. Finally, adjust sugar to your preference
  - a little goes a long way!  '

flavor_description: 'This cocktail is a harmonious blend of bold coffee and sweet
  vanilla, balanced by the smooth vodka and a hint of sugar.  The coffee flavor is
  robust and upfront, with a touch of bitterness that is softened by the warm vanilla
  notes.  The vodka provides a clean, crisp base, while the water ensures a smooth
  and well-rounded finish. '
