bartender_tips: 'For the perfect White Russian, chill your glassware and vodka. Use
  a good quality coffee liqueur, preferably one with a strong coffee flavor. Pour
  the vodka and liqueur first, then gently layer the cream on top to create a beautiful
  gradient. Avoid stirring, as this will create a milky mess. Garnish with a coffee
  bean or a sprinkle of cocoa powder. '

description: 'The White Russian, a creamy and decadent concoction, belongs to the
  Coffee Cocktail family.  Born in the 1940s, likely in Belgium, it is a close cousin
  to the Black Russian, differing only by the addition of cream.  '

flavor_description: 'The White Russian is a creamy, decadent cocktail with a smooth,
  full-bodied flavor. Vodka provides a clean, neutral base, while coffee liqueur adds
  rich, roasted coffee notes and a hint of sweetness. The light cream contributes
  a velvety texture and a subtle, dairy-like sweetness. The overall taste profile
  is indulgent and balanced, with the coffee and cream complementing the vodka beautifully. '
