title: "Mr Black Espresso Martini"
description: "The Mr. Black Espresso Martini is a modern twist on the classic Espresso Martini.  Born from the coffee-cocktail craze, it blends the boldness of cold brew with the smooth elegance of vodka, a nod to the original's creamy coffee-liqueur base. "
flavor_description: "The Mr Black Espresso Martini is a symphony of bold flavors. The Mr Black coffee liqueur brings a rich, roasted coffee taste with hints of chocolate and vanilla.  The vodka adds a smooth, clean alcohol base, while the cold brew coffee contributes a robust, slightly bitter edge.  This cocktail is a perfect blend of sweet, bitter, and boozy, leaving a long, lingering coffee finish. "
bartender_tips: "Use high-quality cold brew for the best flavor. Shake vigorously with ice to chill and emulsify the cocktail.  Don't over-shake, as it can dilute the coffee.  Strain into a chilled martini glass for a perfect presentation.  A sprinkle of coffee beans or a thin slice of orange peel adds a touch of elegance. "
