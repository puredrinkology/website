description: "Thai Iced Coffee, a refreshing blend of coffee, sugar, cream, and cardamom, is a delightful member of the *Coffee Cocktail* family. Originating in Thailand, this beloved beverage reflects the country's rich culinary history and love for strong coffee, sweetened with condensed milk and often spiced with aromatic cardamom. "
flavor_description: "This Thai Iced Coffee is a symphony of sweet and spiced flavors. The strong, robust coffee is tempered by the creamy sweetness of condensed milk and sugar. A subtle warmth from the cardamom adds an exotic touch, rounding out the profile with an almost floral note. This drink is a delightful blend of classic coffee flavors and a touch of the exotic. "
bartender_tips: "For a killer Thai Iced Coffee, use strong, freshly brewed coffee. Don't skimp on the sugar – it should be sweet!  Dissolve the sugar in hot coffee for a silky texture.  Use heavy cream, not milk, for richness.  Toast the cardamom pods before grinding – it releases the aroma and adds a warm complexity.  Serve over ice with a splash of cream on top for an extra touch.

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the visual appeal of a Thai Iced Coffee. Imagine a tall glass filled with the beverage. Consider the following elements:* **Color:** What shades of brown and cream are present? How does the color gradient look?* **Texture:** Is the surface smooth or frothy? Are there any visible layers or swirls? * **Clarity:** Is the coffee clear or opaque? Does it have any visible particles? * **Garnish:** Is there any garnish on top? How does it affect the overall visual impression? **Example:** The Thai Iced Coffee sits in a tall glass, showcasing a deep, rich brown hue at the bottom, gradually transitioning to a lighter, milky cream at the top. The surface is topped with a delicate layer of froth, subtly swirling with the coffee underneath. The coffee itself is slightly opaque, hinting at the cardamom spice within. A sprig of mint adds a touch of freshness and vibrant green to the composition. "
