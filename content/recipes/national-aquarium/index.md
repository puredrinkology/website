bartender_tips: 'This is a layered drink, so build it carefully. Pour the Rum, Vodka,
  and Gin first, followed by Blue Curacao. Gently add Sour Mix, then top with Lemon-Lime
  Soda. Don''t stir! The layering creates a visually stunning effect, so go slow and
  keep it cool.  A light touch with the soda is key to avoid ruining the layering. '

description: 'The National Aquarium belongs to the **multi-spirit sour family**, a
  vibrant group known for their tangy, citrusy profiles.  Its origins remain obscure,
  likely a modern creation born from the desire to blend popular spirits with bright
  blue curacao.  '
