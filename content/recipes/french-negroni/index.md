bartender_tips: 'Chill your glass and ingredients beforehand for a perfectly chilled
  cocktail. Use a good quality gin and Lillet Blanc for optimal flavor.  When expressing
  the orange peel, twist it over the drink to release the oils and add a fragrant
  aroma. Stir gently, not shake, to avoid dilution. '

description: 'The French Negroni is a twist on the classic Negroni, belonging to the
  Negroni family. It swaps Campari for the French aperitif Lillet, adding a lighter,
  more floral twist. Its origin likely stems from the mid-20th century, as Lillet
  rose to popularity in the 1950s. '
family: negroni
flavor_description: 'The French Negroni is a sophisticated twist on the classic, with
  a lighter, more floral profile. The gin''s juniper and citrus notes are balanced
  by the sweet, herbal notes of Lillet and the bittersweet dryness of the vermouth.
  The orange peel adds a bright, zesty finish, creating a complex yet refreshing experience. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt for Describing the French Negroni**Prompt:**Imagine a classic
  Negroni, but with a softer, more approachable character.  **Describe the appearance
  of a French Negroni cocktail, focusing on these details:*** **Color:**  What is
  the overall color of the cocktail? Is it clear, cloudy, or layered? What kind of
  hue does it have? * **Texture:**  Is it smooth, thick, or have a slight sheen?*
  **Garnish:** The cocktail is garnished with an orange peel.  How does the orange
  peel add to the visual appeal? * **Glassware:**  The French Negroni is usually served
  in a classic rocks glass. How does the shape of the glass influence the overall
  appearance of the cocktail?**Bonus:**  Can you incorporate the names of the ingredients
  (Gin, Lillet, Sweet Vermouth) into the description to add further detail and depth?
  **Example:***The French Negroni appears as a captivating amber hue, kissed with
  the subtle warmth of the sweet vermouth. Its smooth, silky texture is reminiscent
  of the gin''s botanicals, while the orange peel garnish adds a splash of vibrant
  orange to the otherwise sophisticated presentation.* '
