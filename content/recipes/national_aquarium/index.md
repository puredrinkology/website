title: "The National Aquarium Cocktail"
fullname: "The National Aquarium Cocktail"
shortname: "National Aquarium"
description: "The National Aquarium belongs to the **multi-spirit sour family**, a vibrant group known for their tangy, citrusy profiles.  Its origins remain obscure, likely a modern creation born from the desire to blend popular spirits with bright blue curacao.  "
flavor_description: "The National Aquarium is a vibrant and refreshing cocktail. The rum and vodka provide a smooth base, while the gin adds a subtle herbal complexity. Blue Cura√ßao contributes a bright, sweet citrus note, balanced by the tartness of sour mix. Lemon-lime soda rounds out the drink with a crisp, bubbly finish, creating a playful, tropical experience. "
bartender_tips: "This is a layered drink, so build it carefully. Pour the Rum, Vodka, and Gin first, followed by Blue Curacao. Gently add Sour Mix, then top with Lemon-Lime Soda. Don't stir! The layering creates a visually stunning effect, so go slow and keep it cool.  A light touch with the soda is key to avoid ruining the layering. "
