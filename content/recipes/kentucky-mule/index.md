bartender_tips: "When making a Kentucky Mule, fresh is best! Squeeze your limes right\
  \ before mixing.  A good ginger syrup is key \u2013 homemade is ideal, but a quality\
  \ bottled option will do.  Don't over-shake, as it'll make the drink too frothy.\
  \  Use a copper mug if you have one, it chills faster and enhances the flavors.\
  \ Finally, top with a splash of soda, not a full pour, for a lighter and more refreshing\
  \ finish. "

  the **Mule family**.  This bourbon-based variation likely originated in the American
  South, combining the refreshing ginger and lime notes of the Mule with the robust
  flavor of Kentucky bourbon. '

flavor_description: 'The Kentucky Mule is a spicy and refreshing cocktail. The sweetness
  of the ginger syrup balances the robust notes of bourbon, while the lime juice adds
  a bright acidity. The soda provides a light and bubbly texture, making it a perfect
  drink for warm weather or after a long day. The overall flavor profile is bold and
  complex, with a delightful kick from the ginger. '

title: The Kentucky Mule Cocktail
visual: '## LLM Prompt:**Imagine a Kentucky Mule cocktail. It''s a refreshing mix
  of ginger syrup, bourbon, lime juice, and soda. Describe its appearance in detail.
  Consider:*** **Color:** What shades of yellow, amber, or brown are present? How
  does the ice affect the color?* **Clarity:** Is it crystal clear, slightly cloudy,
  or heavily frosted with ice?* **Texture:** How does the soda''s fizz interact with
  the other ingredients? What about the ice?* **Garnish:** What kind of garnish might
  be used? How does it affect the overall presentation?* **Glassware:** What type
  of glass is it served in? How does the glass shape enhance its appearance? **Example:**The
  Kentucky Mule gleams in a copper mug, its amber hue tinged with a subtle green from
  the lime juice. The ice cubes, frosted and melting, create a cloudy halo around
  the drink. A delicate layer of foam crowns the surface, a testament to the bubbly
  soda. A sprig of fresh mint, nestled on the rim, adds a verdant touch and a tantalizing
  aroma to the already inviting scene. '
