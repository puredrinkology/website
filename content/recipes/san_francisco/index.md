description: "The San Francisco is a bright and fruity cocktail belonging to the Sour family. It's a modern twist on the classic Whiskey Sour, with vodka replacing whiskey and the addition of banana liqueur and grenadine for a tropical flair. "
flavor_description: "The San Francisco is a sweet and tangy cocktail with a tropical twist. The vodka provides a smooth base, while the creme de banane adds a rich, banana flavor. The grenadine contributes a sweet and tart pomegranate note, and the orange juice provides a refreshing acidity and citrusy aroma. The combination creates a balanced and flavorful drink that's both refreshing and indulgent. "
bartender_tips: "Chill your glass and ingredients beforehand for a refreshing experience.  Use a quality vodka and a good creme de banane for a richer flavor.  Shake vigorously with ice to ensure thorough blending.  Float the grenadine over the top to create a layered visual effect, but be mindful of the ratio to avoid an overly sweet taste. Garnish with an orange twist for a classic touch. "
