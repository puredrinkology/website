bartender_tips: 'Start by layering the Kahlua and vodka to avoid mixing. Gently pour
  the Coca-Cola over the back of a spoon to create a distinct layer. Finish with a
  slow, careful pour of Guinness Stout. Don''t stir! The layers are the beauty of
  this drink. Enjoy the unique flavor profiles as they dance on your palate. '

description: 'The Irish Russian is a unique twist on the classic Black Russian, incorporating
  the creamy, coffee-forward notes of Kahlua with the robust, bittersweet taste of
  Guinness Stout. While its exact origin remains shrouded in mystery, its combination
  of vodka and stout suggests a nod to both Irish and Russian spirits. '

flavor_description: 'The Irish Russian is a surprisingly complex cocktail with a smooth,
  decadent flavor profile.  The vodka provides a clean, crisp base, while the Kahlua
  adds rich, coffee-chocolate notes.  The Coca-Cola brings a touch of sweetness and
  a familiar cola flavor, while the Guinness Stout adds a subtle bitterness and creamy
  texture.  The result is a well-balanced drink that is both refreshing and indulgent. '
