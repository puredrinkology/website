title: The French 75 Cocktail
visual: '## LLM Prompt:Imagine a tall, elegant champagne flute filled with a pale,
  shimmering liquid that captures the essence of a Parisian sunset. The base is a
  delicate blush of pink, hinting at the sweetness of the sugar and the tangy allure
  of the lemon juice. As the liquid climbs, it gradually transitions to a crystal
  clear, almost ethereal hue, mirroring the sparkling effervescence of the champagne.
  Atop this liquid cascade, a vibrant orange slice and a bright red maraschino cherry
  add playful pops of color, completing the scene with a flourish. The gin, though
  not visible, lingers in the air, its subtle botanical aroma adding a sophisticated
  complexity to the visual symphony. Describe this exquisite visual experience, capturing
  the essence of the French 75. '
