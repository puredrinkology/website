bartender_tips: "Start by chilling all ingredients for a smoother, colder drink. \
  \ Measure carefully \u2013 this cocktail is about balance, not strength.  Layer\
  \ the ingredients in the order listed, creating a beautiful visual.  Shake well\
  \ with ice, but don't over-shake to avoid excessive dilution.  Strain into a chilled\
  \ coupe glass.  Garnish with a chocolate shavings or a mini cookie for a playful\
  \ touch. "

flavor_description: 'The Oatmeal Cookie is a decadent, dessert-like cocktail. It''s
  a symphony of rich flavors: the coffee notes of Kahlua mingle with the creamy sweetness
  of Baileys and Butterscotch Schnapps, while a hint of spice from Jagermeister and
  the warm cinnamon of Goldschlager adds complexity. Expect a smooth, full-bodied
  experience, finishing with a lingering sweetness that evokes a freshly baked oatmeal
  cookie. '
