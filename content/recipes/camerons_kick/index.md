title: "Cameron'S Kick"
description: "Cameron's Kick is a spirited riff on the classic Whiskey Sour family, with its tart lemon juice base and whiskey foundation.  The addition of Orgeat Syrup adds a unique, nutty, and sweet dimension, perhaps inspired by the traditional use of Orgeat in tiki cocktails.  "
flavor_description: "Cameron's Kick is a complex yet balanced cocktail. The Orgeat syrup brings a sweet, nutty almond flavor, while the Irish whiskey offers a smooth, warm spice. The blended Scotch adds a smoky, peaty depth, and the lemon juice provides a tart, refreshing touch. The combination creates a delicious, slightly smoky and sweet cocktail with a lingering almond aftertaste. "
bartender_tips: "To make Cameron's Kick sing, balance sweetness and acidity.  Start with a good quality Irish whiskey and blended Scotch.  Use fresh lemon juice and a high-quality orgeat syrup - it's key to the unique flavor profile.  Shake well with ice and double strain into a chilled coupe glass.  Garnish with a lemon twist for a touch of citrus aroma. "
