shortname: "Apello"
description: "The Apello is a vibrant fruit punch, reminiscent of the classic Shirley Temple but with a more sophisticated twist. Its origins are likely rooted in the American home bar scene, emerging as a refreshing, non-alcoholic option for gatherings. "
flavor_description: "Apello is a vibrant, refreshing cocktail with a sweet and tart profile. The orange and grapefruit juices provide a bright citrus kick, while the apple juice adds a mellow sweetness. The maraschino cherry contributes a subtle, almost candy-like note, balancing the tartness and rounding out the flavor. This combination creates a harmonious blend that is both invigorating and enjoyable. "
bartender_tips: "Apello sounds refreshing!  To make it perfect, use fresh-squeezed juice for the best flavor.  Don't over-shake, as you want to retain the natural sweetness of the juices.  A maraschino cherry garnish adds a playful touch, but you can also try a lime wedge for a zesty twist.  Remember to adjust the proportions based on your preference for sweetness and tartness. "
