bartender_tips: 'For the Sweet Tooth, remember that Godiva liqueur is already rich
  and decadent, so don''t overpower it with too much milk. Use a good quality whole
  milk for creaminess.  Chill both the liqueur and milk before mixing. Shake vigorously
  with ice to ensure proper dilution and a smooth, frothy texture.  Serve in a chilled
  coupe or martini glass, garnished with a chocolate shavings or a chocolate-dipped
  strawberry. '
