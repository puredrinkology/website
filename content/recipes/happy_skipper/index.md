title: "Happy Skipper"
description: "The Happy Skipper belongs to the Highball family, characterized by tall, refreshing drinks built with a spirit base and a carbonated mixer.  Its origins likely stem from the 19th century, when rum and ginger ale combinations were popular among seafaring men. "
flavor_description: "The Happy Skipper is a refreshing and vibrant cocktail. The spiced rum provides warm notes of cinnamon and clove, balanced by the crisp bite of ginger ale. A squeeze of lime adds a touch of tartness and acidity, creating a harmonious blend of sweet, spicy, and tangy flavors. The ice chills the drink to perfection, making it ideal for warm weather. "
bartender_tips: "For a Happy Skipper, start with a chilled glass.  Muddle lime wedges to release their oils and create a fragrant base.  Use a good quality spiced rum for depth of flavor.  Top with chilled ginger ale and stir gently, not shake, to maintain the fizz.  Garnish with a lime wheel and enjoy the refreshing, tropical vibe! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Describe the visual appeal of a Happy Skipper cocktail.

Focus on the following aspects:*** **The color and clarity of the drink:** How does the amber rum blend with the clear ginger ale? Is it layered or does it create a single, mixed hue? * **The texture and movement:**  Does the ginger ale create a bubbly head? What happens when the lime wedge is squeezed? * **The interplay of light:** Does the ice sparkle in the glass? How does the light refract through the rum and ginger ale? * **The overall impression:**  Does the cocktail evoke a sense of refreshing lightness or a festive warmth? **Remember to use evocative language and sensory details to paint a vivid picture of this tropical cocktail.** "
