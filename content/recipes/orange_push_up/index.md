fullname: "The Orange Push-Up Cocktail"
shortname: "Orange Push-Up"
description: "The Orange Push-up is a vibrant, nostalgic riff on the classic Sour family.  While its exact origin is unknown, its blend of rum, citrus, and sweet elements echoes the popular Rum Sour of the early 20th century, likely adapted with modern sour mix and a playful, popsicle-inspired name. "
flavor_description: "The Orange Push-up is a sweet and tangy tropical delight. Spiced rum provides warmth and complexity, while grenadine adds a touch of cherry sweetness. Orange juice delivers a refreshing citrus burst, balanced by the tartness of sour mix. It's a nostalgic, playful cocktail that evokes memories of childhood treats. "
bartender_tips: "Use a high-quality spiced rum for depth of flavor.  Shake hard with ice to chill and meld the flavors.  If your sour mix is too tart, adjust with a bit more orange juice.  Don't over-shake; you want a nice balance of creamy texture and a vibrant orange hue.  For a fun presentation, rim the glass with sugar and orange zest. "
