flavor_description: "The Kamikaze is a tart and refreshing cocktail with a punch. The vodka provides a clean, crisp base, while the triple sec adds a touch of orange sweetness and a slight bitterness. The lime juice is the star, delivering a bright acidity that cuts through the sweetness and creates a zesty, tangy finish. Overall, it's a powerful and invigorating drink that's best enjoyed chilled. "
bartender_tips: "For a crisp Kamikaze, use high-quality vodka and triple sec.  Shake well with ice, ensuring the lime juice is freshly squeezed. Strain into a chilled martini glass. Garnish with a lime wheel or a twist for a professional touch. Remember, less ice results in a stronger drink. "
