description: "The Tennessee Mud, a blend of coffee, Jack Daniel's, amaretto, and whipped cream, falls into the coffee cocktail family.  While its exact origin is unknown, it likely emerged in the American South, a region known for its love of both coffee and whiskey. "
flavor_description: "Tennessee Mud is a rich and decadent cocktail. The bold coffee notes are tempered by the smooth sweetness of amaretto, while Jack Daniel's adds a spicy kick. The whipped cream provides a luxurious texture and a touch of vanilla, creating a harmonious blend of flavors that is both comforting and indulgent. "
bartender_tips: "For a smooth Tennessee Mud, use freshly brewed coffee, ideally cooled but not cold.  Chill your Jack Daniels and Amaretto beforehand.  When layering, gently pour the Amaretto over the back of a spoon to avoid mixing.  Top with generous whipped cream, but don't over-sweeten the coffee itself.  Serve immediately! "
