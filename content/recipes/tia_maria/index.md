description: "Tia Maria, a sweet and coffee-forward cocktail, belongs to the **liqueur family**. Originating in Jamaica, its recipe is shrouded in legend, but it is believed to have been crafted by a noblewoman seeking to preserve her family's wealth during the island's turbulent past. "
flavor_description: "Tia Maria is a rich and decadent cocktail with a complex flavor profile. The coffee and rum create a strong, boozy base, while the brown sugar adds a sweet and mellow sweetness. The vanilla extract adds a subtle, warm note, rounding out the flavor profile. It's a smooth and satisfying drink with a lingering coffee aroma. "
bartender_tips: "Use high-quality coffee for the best flavor.  Don't over-steep the coffee, as it can become bitter.  For a richer flavor, use dark rum.  Ensure the brown sugar is fully dissolved before adding the rum, as it helps the sweetness meld with the other flavors.  A dash of cinnamon or nutmeg adds a warm complexity. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a Tia-Maria cocktail.**Imagine a cocktail glass filled with a rich, dark liquid. The color is a deep, almost black brown, like the finest coffee beans, with hints of amber shimmering through. The surface is smooth and inviting, with a slight oily sheen that reflects the light.  A thin layer of foam sits atop the liquid, adding a creamy texture and catching the light with a subtle sheen.  **Describe the visual elements of the Tia-Maria:*** **Color:** How deep is the brown? Are there any lighter shades or highlights?* **Clarity:** Is it transparent or slightly cloudy?* **Texture:** How does the foam look? Is it dense or airy?* **Shine:** Does it shimmer or have a specific type of sheen?* **Any garnish?** Does it have a cherry, orange peel, or any other adornment? **Use vivid language and create an evocative description of this iconic cocktail.** "
