title: "Affair"
description: "The Affair is a refreshing, fruit-forward cocktail that falls into the **highball** family. While its precise origin is unknown, its combination of fruit juices and a liqueur, like many highballs, likely emerged in the late 19th or early 20th century, a time when American bars embraced vibrant, fruity mixes. "
flavor_description: "The Affair is a sweet and fruity cocktail with a tart edge. The strawberry schnapps provides a bright, berry flavor, while the orange juice adds a citrusy sweetness. The cranberry juice contributes a tart, slightly bitter note, and the club soda provides a refreshing fizz. The combination of these flavors creates a well-balanced and enjoyable drink that's perfect for a summer gathering. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Affair, start with a good quality strawberry schnapps for a sweet, fruity base.  Use fresh orange juice for brightness and cranberry juice for tartness.  Club soda adds fizz and helps to cut through the sweetness.  Adjust the ratio of juices to your liking, and always add the club soda last to maintain carbonation.  Serve over ice in a tall glass. "
