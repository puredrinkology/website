title: "Vampiro"
description: "The Vampiro belongs to the **Bloody Mary family**, a group of tomato-based cocktails. Originating in **Mexico**, this refreshing drink blends the savory tang of tomato with the bright acidity of citrus and the kick of tequila. "
flavor_description: "The Vampiro is a vibrant, savory cocktail with a tangy kick. Tequila's warmth mingles with the acidity of tomato and citrus juices, creating a complex flavor.  The sweetness of sugar syrup balances the tartness, while a pinch of salt enhances the overall complexity.  It's a refreshing and satisfying drink, perfect for a warm day or a night out. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Vampiro, balance is key. Use a high-quality tequila for depth.  Don't overpower the tomato juice with citrus; use just enough lime and orange to brighten.  A touch of sugar syrup balances the acidity, but don't make it sweet.  Use a good pinch of salt to enhance the savory notes and rim your glass with a salted edge for a sophisticated touch. "

instructions:

  - item: "Bartenders may first \"rim\" the glass with Kosher Salt, which is done by placing a layer of Kosher Salt on a chopping board, moistening the glass\' rim with lime juice or water, and then placing the upside down glass rim onto the Kosher Salt, so that the salt sticks to the moistened rim."

visual: "## LLM Prompt:Imagine a tall glass, filled with a vibrant, almost blood-red liquid. The color is not uniform, but rather marbled with streaks of bright orange and a hint of green. The top of the drink is adorned with a delicate layer of foam, almost like a fluffy cloud, tinged with a faint orange hue.  The glass is chilled, condensation clinging to the sides and creating a shimmering effect. Tiny specks of salt cling to the rim, a salty counterpoint to the sweet and tart flavors within.  Describe the visual appeal of this cocktail, focusing on its colors, textures, and overall presentation. What kind of glass would it be served in? How would you describe the overall mood of the drink? "
