description: "The Flaming Lamborghini belongs to the layered shot family, a popular style originating in the 1980s. Its vibrant layers, often ignited for a dramatic presentation,  showcase a playful mix of sweet liqueurs like Kahlua, Sambuca, Blue Curacao, and Baileys Irish Cream. "
flavor_description: "The Flaming Lamborghini is a layered cocktail that bursts with sweet, creamy, and boozy flavors. The Kahlua and Baileys offer a rich, coffee and chocolate base, while the Sambuca adds a licorice kick. The Blue Curacao provides a subtle citrus tang and vibrant blue hue.  Overall, it's a decadent and slightly sweet experience with a complex interplay of flavors. "
bartender_tips: "This is a layered shot, so use a shot glass and layer carefully. Start with the heaviest ingredient, Baileys, then Kahlua, followed by Sambuca. The Blue Curacao is drizzled on top for a visual effect.  Be mindful of the Sambuca's flammability.  Light it carefully with a long match and let the flames subside before consuming."

Is it a small, controlled flame, or a larger, more dramatic spectacle? What color is the flame?* **Overall impression:**  Does the cocktail appear elegant and sophisticated, or bold and fiery?  What kind of mood does it evoke? **Bonus:*** **Garnish:**  Does the cocktail have a garnish? If so, describe it.* **Glass:**  What kind of glass is the cocktail served in?

The layers of liqueur create a beautiful gradient, starting with a dark brown base of Kahlua, transitioning to a clear layer of Sambuca, a vibrant blue layer of Blue Curacao, and finally a creamy white top layer of Baileys Irish Cream. A small, flickering flame dances atop the creamy layer, casting an orange glow on the surrounding glass. The combination of colors and textures creates an elegant, yet bold and fiery aesthetic, making the Flaming Lamborghini a truly captivating cocktail. "
