Light cream adds a touch of richness and a velvety texture, making this a luxurious and indulgent drink. "
bartender_tips: "This cocktail is a creamy delight, but requires a bit of finesse. Chill your ingredients, especially the cream, for a smooth and refreshing drink.  Use a good quality Amaretto and Creme de Cacao for the best flavor.  Shake well with ice, and strain into a chilled coupe glass for a flawless presentation.  Garnish with a chocolate curl for a touch of elegance. "
