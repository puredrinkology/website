title: "The Bumble Bee Shot"
fullname: "The Bumble Bee Shot"
shortname: "Bumble Bee"
author: "Pure Drinkology"
description: "The Bumble Bee belongs to the layered shot family, a popular style originating in the late 20th century.  Its distinct layered appearance, achieved by carefully pouring the heavier Baileys, followed by Kahlua, and finally the lighter Sambuca,  creates a visually striking drink. "
flavor_description: "The Bumble Bee is a creamy, decadent delight. The Baileys Irish Cream provides a smooth, sweet base with notes of chocolate and vanilla. Kahlua adds a rich coffee flavor and a touch of bitterness, while the Sambuca lends a unique licorice and anise kick. The combination creates a well-balanced, slightly sweet cocktail with a lingering, complex finish. "
bartender_tips: "The Bumble Bee is a layered cocktail, so precision is key.  Chill your glasses thoroughly and use a bar spoon to slowly pour each liqueur, starting with the heaviest (Baileys), followed by Kahlua, and finish with the lightest (Sambuca).  Don't stir! The layers are the beauty of the drink. A gentle pour and a steady hand will create a stunning visual that's as delicious as it looks. "
