description: "The 151 Florida Bushwacker belongs to the **creamy cocktail family**, a descendant of the **Hurricane**, born in the **1970s in Florida**. Its potent blend of rums, liqueurs, and dairy creates a sweet, decadent, and dangerously smooth experience. "
flavor_description: "The 151 Florida Bushwacker is a potent, tropical delight.  The sweet, coconutty notes of Malibu and coconut liqueur are amplified by the creamy vanilla ice cream and milk.  Dark creme de cacao adds depth and a hint of chocolate, while Cointreau brings a citrusy complexity.  The 151 rum packs a powerful punch, creating a lingering warmth that lingers long after the last sip. "
bartender_tips: "This is a recipe that benefits from proper layering. Start with the heavier ingredients at the bottom: dark creme de cacao, milk, vanilla ice cream. Then add the lighter ones, like the rums, coconut liqueur, and Cointreau.  Don't over-blend, you want some texture. Chill the glass beforehand and use a good quality rum for a truly decadent Bushwacker. "

visual: "Imagine a thick, creamy, milkshake-like concoction.  The color is a rich, tropical brown, almost the color of a sunset over a palm-lined beach.  Tiny specks of vanilla ice cream swirl throughout the drink, adding an almost frosted quality to the surface.  A light dusting of cocoa powder crowns the top, like a whisper of chocolate in the tropical paradise. The whole thing is topped with a maraschino cherry, its bright red color contrasting with the brown hues below. "
