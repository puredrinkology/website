description: "The Brooklyn is a classic Manhattan variation, hailing from the 19th century.  This  rye-based cocktail, sweetened with dry vermouth and a touch of maraschino, boasts a complex flavor profile balanced by bitter notes from Angostura bitters. It's a sophisticated choice for any occasion. "
flavor_description: "The Brooklyn is a dry, complex cocktail with a bold rye whiskey backbone. Dry vermouth adds a herbaceous and slightly bitter edge, balanced by the sweet, cherry-like notes of maraschino liqueur. Angostura bitters contribute a subtle aromatic warmth, while a maraschino cherry provides a final burst of sweetness and fruity character. The overall experience is a sophisticated, slightly bitter, and ultimately refreshing drink. "
bartender_tips: "Chill your ingredients! A Brooklyn is best enjoyed ice-cold.  Use high-quality rye for a richer flavor. Measure your vermouth carefully - too much will drown out the rye. A dash of bitters adds complexity.  Muddle the cherry for a touch of sweetness before adding to your shaker. Garnish with a cherry - optional, but pretty! "
