description: "The Vieux Carre is a classic New Orleans cocktail, a member of the Old Fashioned family, characterized by its rich, complex flavors.  Created in the 1930s at the Hotel Monteleone's Carousel Bar, it's a sophisticated blend of rye, brandy, sweet vermouth, Benedictine, and Peychaud's Bitters. "
flavor_description: "The Vieux Carre is a complex and sophisticated cocktail. Its rye whiskey backbone provides spice and backbone, while the brandy lends fruitiness and richness. Sweet vermouth adds sweetness and herbal notes, while Benedictine brings a hint of honey and spice. Peychaud's bitters round out the profile with a touch of bitter orange and clove. The result is a balanced and deeply flavorful cocktail that is both warming and refreshing. "
bartender_tips: "When making a Vieux Carr√©, chilling the glass beforehand is key for a refreshing experience.  Use a good quality rye and brandy for depth of flavor. Don't skimp on the Benedictine; it adds complexity.  Stir gently, not vigorously, to avoid bruising the ingredients.  Garnish with a lemon twist and enjoy the rich, elegant complexity. "

visual: "##  LLM Prompt:Imagine a cocktail glass filled with a deep amber liquid, its surface shimmering with a subtle oiliness.  The color is reminiscent of polished mahogany, but with a hint of warm, reddish-brown undertones. Tiny bubbles, like whispers of spice, dance around the edges of the glass, slowly rising towards the surface. The aroma, a complex blend of sweet and smoky notes, wafts upwards, promising a taste as intriguing as its appearance. **Describe this cocktail in detail, focusing on its color, texture, and how the light plays off its surface. You can use metaphors and vivid imagery to capture its unique visual appeal. ** "
