bartender_tips: 'When making the Rhyme or Reason cocktail, focus on the balance.  Ensure
  the Blood Orange Cordial sweetness complements the rye''s spice, while the Orgeat
  adds a subtle almond note.  Use fresh lime juice for that bright acidity.  Shake
  hard with ice to chill and dilute the mix, then strain into a chilled coupe.  Garnish
  with a blood orange wheel for a beautiful presentation. '
