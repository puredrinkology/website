description: "The Frozen Pineapple Daiquiri is a refreshing twist on the classic Daiquiri family, a rum-based cocktail originating in Cuba.  This tropical take swaps the traditional lime for pineapple, creating a sweet and tangy summer treat perfect for sipping poolside. "
flavor_description: "This frozen delight bursts with bright, tropical flavors.  Sweet pineapple takes center stage, perfectly balanced by the tartness of fresh lime juice. The light rum adds a subtle, mellow warmth that complements the fruity sweetness without overpowering it.  The result is a refreshing, creamy, and utterly delicious cocktail that embodies the essence of summer. "
bartender_tips: "For the best frozen pineapple daiquiri, use fresh pineapple for the sweetest flavor.  Muddle the fruit thoroughly to release its juices.  Balance the sweetness with tart lime juice, adjusting to taste.  Use a good quality light rum for a clean, bright flavor.  To ensure a smooth consistency, use a good quality blender and blend until completely smooth.  Don't forget a salted rim for an extra touch of sweetness!  Enjoy! "
