visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing the Shot-gun Cocktail:**Imagine a shot glass filled with a deep amber liquid, its color a rich blend of honey and oak.  The surface shimmers with a slight oily sheen, catching the light and reflecting a thousand tiny rainbows.  Beneath the surface, subtle swirls of brown and gold dance, hinting at the complex interplay of flavors within.  The aroma is potent, a heady mix of vanilla, caramel, and spice, with a hint of smokiness lingering in the air.  Describe the visual and olfactory experience of this cocktail, paying close attention to the specific nuances of each component (Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, Wild Turkey) as they contribute to the overall appearance and aroma. ** "
