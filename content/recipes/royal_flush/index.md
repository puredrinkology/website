description: "The Royal Flush, a vibrant blend of Crown Royal whiskey, peach schnapps, Chambord, and cranberry juice, falls squarely into the Fruity Cocktail family. This modern concoction likely emerged in the late 20th century, mirroring the growing popularity of sweet, easy-to-drink cocktails. "
flavor_description: "The Royal Flush is a sweet and fruity cocktail with a smooth, balanced finish. The Crown Royal provides a rich, vanilla-forward base, while the peach schnapps adds a juicy, summery sweetness.  Chambord brings a luxurious raspberry depth, and the cranberry juice adds tartness and a vibrant color. "
bartender_tips: "Chill all ingredients beforehand for a perfectly crisp cocktail.  When shaking, use a light hand to avoid over-diluting the flavors.  For a vibrant red hue, use high-quality cranberry juice.  Garnish with a fresh raspberry and a sprig of mint for a touch of elegance. "
