bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Hemingway Special, use a good quality white rum. Freshly
  squeezed grapefruit juice is key. Don''t be afraid to use a generous amount of maraschino
  liqueur, it balances the bitterness of the grapefruit.  Shake vigorously with ice
  to chill and dilute.  Strain into a chilled coupe glass and garnish with a grapefruit
  twist or a maraschino cherry. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt: Describe the Hemingway SpecialImagine a **tall, slender glass**,
  filled with a **bright, pale pink liquid** that shimmers slightly. The **ice cubes**
  nestled within are clear and pristine, slowly melting into the drink.  The **rim
  of the glass** is **frosted with a thin layer of sugar** creating a subtle sweetness
  that contrasts the **tart grapefruit juice** which forms the foundation of the cocktail.  A
  **single maraschino cherry** sits perched on the rim, adding a touch of vibrant
  red to the otherwise subdued palette.  The **subtle scent** of rum and lime wafts
  from the glass, hinting at the refreshing and slightly bitter flavour that awaits.  **Describe
  the overall visual appeal of the Hemingway Special. Is it elegant? Simple? Refreshing?  How
  does the color and clarity of the drink contribute to its overall aesthetic?** '
