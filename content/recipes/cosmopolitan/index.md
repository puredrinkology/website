flavor_description: "The Cosmopolitan is a tart and sweet symphony. Vodka provides a clean, neutral base, while lime juice delivers a sharp, citrusy bite. Cointreau adds a touch of orange sweetness and a hint of floral complexity. Cranberry juice rounds out the profile with its tart, berry sweetness, creating a perfectly balanced and refreshing cocktail that is both sophisticated and approachable. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Cosmo, chill everything - your shaker, ingredients, and even the glass.  Use fresh lime juice, not bottled.  Measure carefully, as a little too much cranberry juice can make it overly sweet.  Shake hard with ice to chill thoroughly, then strain into a chilled martini glass.  Garnish with a lime twist for a classic touch. "
