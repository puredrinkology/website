bartender_tips: 'To elevate your Jack''s Vanilla Coke, use a good quality Tennessee
  Whiskey. For a smoother vanilla note, use a high-quality extract.  Chill the Coca-Cola
  beforehand for a crisp, refreshing drink.  A dash of Angostura bitters adds complexity.  Don''t
  over-shake, you want a gentle mix, not a foamy mess.  Serve over ice, garnished
  with a cherry or orange peel for that classic touch. '

flavor_description: 'Jack''s Vanilla Coke is a sweet and smoky delight.  The Tennessee
  whiskey provides a smooth, slightly spicy base, while the vanilla extract adds a
  warm, comforting sweetness.  The Coca-Cola balances everything out with a refreshing,
  effervescent bite, creating a harmonious blend of flavors.  The overall experience
  is reminiscent of a classic whiskey and coke, but with a subtle vanilla twist that
  elevates it to a new level of sophistication. '

title: The Jacks Vanilla Coke Shake
visual: '## LLM Prompt: Imagine a classic highball glass filled with ice, the cubes
  gleaming like tiny diamonds.  The glass is filled with a deep amber liquid, the
  color of rich caramel, with a faint, swirling haze of vanilla. Tiny bubbles rise
  from the depths of the drink, creating a gentle effervescence.  The surface is crowned
  with a dark, rich cola, almost black, with a few stray bubbles clinging to the side
  of the glass. The aroma is a tantalizing blend of smoky whiskey, sweet vanilla,
  and the crisp bite of cola.  Describe this visually appealing cocktail in detail,
  highlighting its color, texture, and the overall impression it gives off. '
