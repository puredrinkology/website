bartender_tips: 'Use a good quality bourbon for best results.  The Benedictine adds
  sweetness and herbal notes, so adjust the amount to your preference.  A good twist
  of lemon peel adds a refreshing touch and elevates the drink.  Don''t over-muddle
  the peel - just a light squeeze to release oils.  Serve chilled in a coupe glass
  for a classic presentation. '

flavor_description: 'The Kentucky Colonel offers a complex and harmonious blend. The
  robust, spicy notes of bourbon are beautifully balanced by the sweet, herbal complexity
  of Benedictine. A subtle citrus lift from the lemon peel adds a refreshing touch,
  cutting through the richness. The result is a smooth, warming cocktail that lingers
  on the palate with a hint of spice and citrus. '
