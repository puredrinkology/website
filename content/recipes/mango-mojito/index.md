bartender_tips: "Muddle the mint and mango aggressively to release their flavors.\
  \ Don't over-muddle, you want a smooth pur\xE9e, not a paste. Use a quality white\
  \ rum and fresh lime juice. Don't skimp on the ice, it dilutes the cocktail and\
  \ keeps it cool. Adjust the sweetness to your liking with additional mango pur\xE9\
  e or simple syrup. Top with soda water for a refreshing fizz. "
