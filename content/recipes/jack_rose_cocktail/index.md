fullname: "The Jack Rose  Cocktail"
shortname: "Jack Rose "
description: "The Jack Rose, a vibrant pink concoction, is a classic sour, a family of cocktails typically made with a spirit, citrus juice, and a sweetener.  Originating in the early 20th century, its exact birthplace is debated, but it's linked to New York City's bar scene. "
flavor_description: "The Jack Rose is a sweet and tart delight. The apple brandy delivers a warm, fruity base with notes of apple and spice. Grenadine adds a vibrant sweetness, while the lime juice provides a refreshing acidity. The combination creates a harmonious balance between sweet, tart, and warm, leaving a lingering apple and spice finish. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Jack Rose, chill your glassware and use good quality apple brandy.  The lime juice should be fresh, not bottled. A good shake is key to ensure the cocktail is well-chilled and the ingredients are fully combined.  To ensure a beautiful layered effect, pour the grenadine slowly over the back of a spoon so it settles at the bottom. Garnish with a lime wheel. "
