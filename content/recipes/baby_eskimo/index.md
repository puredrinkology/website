title: "The Baby Eskimo Shake"
fullname: "The Baby Eskimo Shake"
shortname: "Baby Eskimo"
description: "The Baby Eskimo belongs to the creamy cocktail family, similar to the White Russian. Its origin is likely American, emerging in the mid-20th century as a simple, comforting drink popular in home bars and family gatherings. "
flavor_description: "The Baby Eskimo is a creamy, decadent delight. The Kahlua lends its rich coffee and chocolate notes, balanced by the sweet vanilla of the ice cream and the smooth, milky base. This drink is a comforting fusion of flavors, offering a delightful contrast between the slightly bitter coffee and the sweet, creamy elements.  It's like a warm hug in a glass, perfect for a chilly evening. "
bartender_tips: "This drink is all about balance and texture. Use good quality Kahlua for a richer flavor.  Chill the milk beforehand for a smoother blend.  Use a blender and pulse the ice cream until smooth, then add the milk and Kahlua, blending just until incorporated. Don't over-blend!  A quick pulse is key for a creamy, frothy consistency. Garnish with a sprinkle of cocoa powder or chocolate shavings. "
