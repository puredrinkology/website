description: "The AT&T is a unique twist on the classic Gin & Tonic, belonging to the Highball family. Its origin is unclear, but the name likely references the telecommunications giant's connection to gin,  as it was once distributed by AT&T employees during the Prohibition era. "
flavor_description: "The AT&T is a refreshing and crisp cocktail. The vodka and gin combine for a smooth, slightly herbal base that is balanced by the tonic water's bitter, quinine notes. The combination is light and effervescent, making it perfect for a hot summer day or a casual gathering.  The gin adds a subtle botanical complexity, while the vodka provides a clean and neutral canvas.  It's a simple yet delightful drink that showcases the versatility of both vodka and gin. "
bartender_tips: "The AT&T is a simple yet refreshing cocktail, but getting the balance right is key. Use a high-quality gin for a better flavor profile. Start with a 1:1 ratio of vodka and gin, and adjust to your liking.  Chill the tonic water before serving to keep it bubbly. Don't over-mix the cocktail, as it can make the gin taste overly bitter.  A simple garnish of lime or lemon wedge enhances the taste. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for AT&T Cocktail Description:**Imagine a tall, slender glass filled with a sparkling, light blue liquid. The liquid is effervescent, with tiny bubbles rising to the surface and bursting with a soft fizz.  The glass is adorned with a thin slice of lime, its green hue contrasting beautifully with the vibrant blue.  The ice cubes, clear and pristine, clink softly as they gently jostle against the glass.  **What does the aroma of this drink evoke?**  Is it fresh and citrusy, with a hint of juniper?  Or does it carry a subtle floral note, perhaps from the tonic water?  **Finally, describe the taste.  Is it crisp and refreshing, with a subtle hint of sweetness balanced by a smooth, vodka-forward finish?  Or does the gin leave its mark, imparting a more pronounced juniper flavor?** Please provide a detailed and evocative description of the AT&T cocktail, focusing on its visual, olfactory, and taste aspects.
