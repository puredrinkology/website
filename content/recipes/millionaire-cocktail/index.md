bartender_tips: '**For a velvety texture:**  Use a dry shake to emulsify the egg white
  before adding ice for a silky, frothy top.  **Don''t skimp on the Absinthe:** A
  tiny splash is key for its aroma, but don''t overdo it.  **Flavor balance:** Adjust
  the orange liqueur and lemon juice for your desired sweetness and tartness.  **Presentation:**  Use
  a coupe or martini glass for its elegant shape and showcase the frothy top. '
