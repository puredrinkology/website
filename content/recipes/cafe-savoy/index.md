bartender_tips: "For a smooth Cafe Savoy, use freshly brewed, strong coffee. Don't\
  \ over-chill the milk \u2013 you want it cold, but not icy. When shaking, use a\
  \ vigorous motion to ensure proper emulsification. Adjust the sweetness to your\
  \ liking by adding simple syrup, but remember, the coffee should be the star. Garnish\
  \ with a coffee bean or a sprinkle of cinnamon for a touch of elegance. "
