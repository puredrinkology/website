bartender_tips: 'To make your Kiwi Papaya Smoothie a delight, start with ripe, flavorful
  fruits.  Don''t over-blend, you want a slightly chunky texture. For a vibrant color,
  use a quality green kiwi. A splash of lime juice adds brightness, and a touch of
  honey balances the sweetness. Serve chilled and garnish with a fresh kiwi slice
  for an extra touch. '
