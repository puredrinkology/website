title: "Paloma"
description: "The Paloma, a refreshing blend of tequila and grapefruit soda, belongs to the Highball family. It originated in Mexico in the 1950s, gaining popularity as a simple yet delicious alternative to the Margarita. "
flavor_description: "The Paloma is a refreshingly tart and sweet cocktail. The tequila provides a smooth, slightly spicy base, while the grapefruit soda adds a bright, citrusy zing. The combination is balanced and crisp, with a touch of bitterness from the grapefruit.  It's a delightful summer drink, perfect for a hot day. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Paloma, use a good quality tequila - reposado or anejo adds complexity.  Chill your ingredients well.  Don't just shake, muddle a lime wedge for extra aroma and flavor.  Use a highball glass filled with ice for maximum dilution.  Top with a generous amount of grapefruit soda, and garnish with a lime wheel. "
