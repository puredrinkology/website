description: "The Galah, with its rum base, bitter Campari, sweet banana liqueur, and tropical fruit juices, is a vibrant take on the classic Tiki cocktail family.  While its specific origin is unclear, its flavors evoke the spirit of Polynesian-inspired cocktails that gained popularity in the mid-20th century. "
flavor_description: "The Galah offers a vibrant tropical punch with a bittersweet edge. The dark rum provides a rich, molasses sweetness that blends harmoniously with the creamy banana notes of Cr√®me de Banane. Campari adds a bitter, citrusy complexity, while pineapple and lime juices contribute a refreshing acidity and tropical fruitiness. It's a playful balance of sweet, bitter, and tart, perfect for a warm evening. "
bartender_tips: "To make The Galah shine, prioritize freshness. Use high-quality dark rum for depth and a good Campari for its bitter bite.  Shake your cocktail well with ice to thoroughly chill and dilute it.  This helps balance the sweetness of the creme de banane and pineapple juice.  Finish with a lime wheel for a vibrant touch. "
