description: "The Rum Screwdriver is a member of the classic **Screwdriver family**, a simple blend of citrus juice and spirits. While its exact origin is debated, it's believed to have emerged in the 1940s, likely in the USA, as a variation on the Vodka Screwdriver. "
flavor_description: "The Rum Screwdriver offers a vibrant, refreshing taste. The light rum brings a smooth, mellow sweetness with subtle hints of molasses and spice. This blends beautifully with the bright, tangy acidity of the orange juice, creating a balanced and thirst-quenching experience. The overall profile is tropical, slightly sweet, and delightfully tart, perfect for a sunny day or a light and enjoyable cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "Start with a tall glass filled with ice.  Pour in the light rum, then top off with fresh orange juice.  Use a good quality rum, and freshly squeezed orange juice for the best flavor.  Garnish with an orange wedge or a maraschino cherry.  Don't over-shake, as you don't want to dilute the rum too much. "
