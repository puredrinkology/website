description: "The Dry Martini, a classic member of the Martini family, is a gin-based cocktail with roots in 19th-century America. Its austere dryness, a testament to the dominance of gin over vermouth, is what defines it.  "
flavor_description: "The Dry Martini is a symphony of crisp, clean flavors. Gin's juniper and botanicals take center stage, with dry vermouth adding subtle herbal notes and a hint of dryness. The olive, a classic garnish, contributes a briny, savory touch, balancing the gin's boldness with a touch of earthiness. It's a sophisticated, refreshing cocktail with a long, satisfying finish. "
bartender_tips: "**Chill everything!**  Gin, vermouth, and the glass should all be ice cold.  **Use a quality gin** and a **dry vermouth**.  **Stir, don't shake!**  Shaking will dilute the cocktail.  **Garnish with an olive or a lemon twist.**  Remember, **a good Martini is all about balance**.  Don't overpower the gin with too much vermouth.  **Taste as you go** and adjust the vermouth to your liking. "

visual: "##  Describe the visual appeal of a Dry Martini, crafted with gin, dry vermouth, and olives. **Consider these elements:*** **Glass:** A classic chilled martini glass, with its iconic V-shape and stem.* **Liquid:** The clear, almost transparent gin, possibly with a slight hint of ice-cold chill. * **Vermouth:**  The subtle whisper of dry vermouth, adding a faint, pale-yellow hue to the gin. * **Olive:** A single, plump green olive, resting elegantly on a cocktail stick or skewer, or perhaps submerged in the gin.  * **Presentation:**  The overall look of the drink.  Is it minimalist, with just the olive as a garnish? Or are there other embellishments, like a twist of lemon peel?  How does the condensation from the chilled glass contribute to the visual appeal? **Please provide a detailed description that evokes the visual beauty of this classic cocktail.** "
