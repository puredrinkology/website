description: "The Zorro cocktail, with its creamy base and minty sweetness, belongs to the **layered shooter family**, a group of drinks known for their distinct visual layers. Its origins are uncertain, likely a modern concoction born in the home-bartending realm. "
flavor_description: "The Zorro is a creamy, minty delight with a surprising kick. The smooth Baileys and rich Sambuca blend beautifully, creating a sweet and slightly licorice-forward base. The White Creme de Menthe adds a refreshing minty coolness, balancing the sweetness with a subtle herbal touch. The overall effect is decadent, smooth, and pleasantly refreshing. "
bartender_tips: "For a smooth Zorro, layer the ingredients carefully. Start with a splash of Sambuca at the bottom, followed by Baileys for a creamy middle, and finish with White Creme de Menthe, creating a distinct green top layer.  Chill your glasses beforehand and use a bar spoon to gently pour the layers. This will ensure the flavors don't mix too quickly, allowing for a visually appealing and tasty experience. "
