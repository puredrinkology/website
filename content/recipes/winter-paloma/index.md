bartender_tips: '**Winter Paloma Tips:*** **Fresh is Best:** Use freshly squeezed
  grapefruit and lime juice for optimal flavor.* **Pepper Power:**  Add a pinch of
  freshly ground black pepper to the shaker for a warming kick.* **Sugar Solution:**  Agave
  syrup provides a smooth sweetness, but you can substitute simple syrup.* **Chill
  Factor:**  Serve the cocktail chilled for a refreshing winter experience.* **Garnish
  Game:** A grapefruit wedge and a sprig of rosemary elevate the presentation. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt:Describe the appearance of a Winter Paloma cocktail. It is
  made with tequila, grapefruit juice, lime juice, agave syrup, and a touch of black
  pepper. Imagine the drink sitting in a rocks glass with ice. Focus on the colors,
  clarity, and any potential garnishes. **Bonus:** Consider how the addition of black
  pepper might affect the visual appeal of the drink. Does it create a layered effect,
  or add subtle hints of color? '
