bartender_tips: 'This cocktail''s complexity lies in its balance.  Use a good quality
  rye for backbone and a high-proof Absinthe for its anise kick.  Ensure the Green
  Chartreuse isn''t overpowering, use it judiciously.  The pineapple syrup adds sweetness,
  so don''t go overboard with lime juice.  Shake hard with ice to chill, and strain
  to avoid any ice shards in your drink. A splash of bitters adds complexity, but
  go easy, a dash will suffice. '

description: 'Flowering Fields is a contemporary twist on the classic Sazerac, a New
  Orleans cocktail born in the 19th century.  It utilizes the signature rye whiskey
  and absinthe base, but elevates it with botanicals like green Chartreuse and citrus
  notes, giving it a modern, floral touch. '

flavor_description: 'Flowering Fields bursts with a vibrant, botanical symphony. The
  sweetness of pineapple syrup dances with the spicy rye and tangy lime, while Green
