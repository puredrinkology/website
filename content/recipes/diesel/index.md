fullname: "The Diesel Beer"
shortname: "Diesel"
description: "Diesel belongs to the Highball family, a category known for its simple, refreshing blends of spirits and mixers. This particular concoction, likely originating in the UK, takes inspiration from the classic shandy (beer and lemonade) with a twist, substituting cider for lemonade and adding blackcurrant cordial for a tart, fruity complexity. "
flavor_description: "The Diesel is a surprisingly balanced blend. The crisp lager provides a clean, malty base, while the cider adds a touch of sweetness and fruitiness. The blackcurrant cordial then takes center stage, offering a burst of tart, dark berry flavor. It's a refreshing and slightly tart cocktail, perfect for a hot day or a casual gathering. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Diesel, start with a good quality lager.  Use a high-quality blackcurrant cordial, as its flavor will be prominent.  Don't be afraid to adjust the cider ratio to your taste.  A splash of lemon juice adds brightness, and a blackcurrant garnish adds a touch of elegance.  Chill all ingredients before mixing to ensure a refreshing drink. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Diesel Cocktail Description:**Imagine a tall glass filled with a dark, almost black liquid, swirling with hints of amber. The liquid is topped with a frothy head, reminiscent of a dark beer, but with a subtle blush of purple at the edges.  Tiny bubbles rise from the depths, like wisps of smoke. This is the Diesel cocktail. Describe the visual appeal of this cocktail, using imagery that evokes its dark, brooding, but subtly sweet and complex nature.** **Bonus:** Include sensory details like the scent of the cocktail, the feeling of the glass in your hand, and the sound of the ice clinking as you sip.
