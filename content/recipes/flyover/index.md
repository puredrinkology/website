The Rio Red Grapefruit Cordial provides a bright, citrusy base with a hint of bitterness, balanced by the sweetness of the ginger syrup. Orange liqueur adds a touch of orange zest and warmth, while bourbon contributes depth and spice. A squeeze of lime juice brightens the profile and creates a refreshing finish.  Overall, the Flyover is a harmonious blend of sweet, tart, and spicy notes, making it a truly unique and memorable drink. "
