description: "The Caipirinha, a vibrant blend of sugar, lime, and cachaça, hails from Brazil and belongs to the **sour** cocktail family. This iconic South American drink is a refreshing, tangy classic, similar to other sour cocktails like the Margarita and Daiquiri. "
flavor_description: "The Caipirinha is a refreshing, tart, and slightly sweet cocktail. The lime juice dominates, offering a bright, citrusy zing, balanced by the sweetness of the sugar. Cachaça, a Brazilian sugarcane spirit, adds a unique, earthy complexity with subtle hints of molasses and spice. The combination creates a harmonious balance of sweet, sour, and spicy flavors, leaving a clean and invigorating finish. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Caipirinha, muddle the sugar and lime wedges *thoroughly*, until the lime is fully broken down and the sugar is dissolved. This releases the lime's essential oils and creates a delicious base. Use a good quality cachaça, ideally aged for a smoother taste. Finally, add ice and top with cachaça, stirring gently to chill. Don't over-stir, as this will dilute the cocktail. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a Caipirinha.**Imagine a tall, clear glass filled with ice.  The ice is partially submerged in a vibrant, cloudy, light green liquid.  This liquid is a mixture of muddled lime wedges and their juice, along with the clear, colorless spirit of Cachaça.  Atop the ice and liquid, a thin layer of sugar crystals rests, creating a delicate, sparkling sheen.  The overall effect is refreshing and invigorating, with the vibrant green color hinting at the tangy lime flavor within.****Optional details to include in your description:*** Mention the frosted rim of the glass.* Describe the small, bruised lime wedges at the bottom of the glass.* Add a detail about the texture of the drink, highlighting the crushed ice and the smooth, slightly syrupy liquid.* Include a sensory detail like the scent of fresh lime and sugarcane.
