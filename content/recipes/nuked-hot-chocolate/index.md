bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Nuked Hot Chocolate, focus on quality ingredients.
  Use Dutch-processed cocoa powder for a richer flavor.  Don''t over-sweeten, start
  with less sugar and adjust to taste.  A splash of vanilla extract elevates the flavor.  Finally,
  heat the milk gently on the stovetop instead of microwaving for a smoother, creamier
  texture. '
