bartender_tips: 'This sounds like a fun, layered cocktail!  Start by chilling your
  glass.  Pour the Baileys in first, followed by the Bourbon and Vodka.  Then carefully
  layer the orange juice on top to create a beautiful visual.  You could use a bar
  spoon to help with the layering.  Garnish with a wedge of orange, and enjoy! '

description: 'The Irish Curdling Cow is a unique concoction that doesn''t fit neatly
  into any established cocktail family. It''s likely a modern invention, blending
  the creaminess of Irish Cream with the boldness of bourbon and vodka, and the citrusy
  sweetness of orange juice. It''s a playful combination defying categorization, much
  like its quirky name. '

flavor_description: 'The Irish Curdling Cow is a decadent and complex cocktail. The
  sweetness of Baileys Irish Cream is balanced by the boldness of bourbon and the
  clean cut of vodka. Orange juice adds a vibrant citrus note, creating a creamy,
  slightly tart, and ultimately comforting experience.  The result is a smooth and
  enjoyable blend of flavors, with a slight lingering warmth from the bourbon. '
