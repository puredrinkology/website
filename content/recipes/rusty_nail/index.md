fullname: "The Rusty Nail Cocktail"
shortname: "Rusty Nail"
description: "The Rusty Nail is a member of the **Whisky Cocktail** family.  It originated in the 1930s, likely in the UK, and is known for its simple yet sophisticated blend of Scotch whisky and the sweet, herbal liqueur Drambuie. "
flavor_description: "The Rusty Nail is a bold, warm, and comforting cocktail.  The smoky peat of the Scotch is softened by the honeyed sweetness of Drambuie, creating a complex and balanced flavor.  A subtle citrus note from the lemon peel adds a bright, refreshing touch.  This classic drink is perfect for sipping on a chilly evening or after a hearty meal. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Rusty Nail, use a good quality Scotch and high-quality Drambuie.  Chill both ingredients before mixing.  Gently stir, not shake, to avoid diluting the flavors.  Express the lemon peel over the drink to release its oils, then discard it.  Serve in an old fashioned glass with a large ice cube for a slow melt and consistent chill. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:Imagine a cocktail, nestled in a rocks glass. The liquid within is a rich, deep amber, reminiscent of polished mahogany. It shimmers slightly, revealing subtle hints of gold as the ice clinks against the glass. A thin slice of lemon peel, elegantly twisted, rests upon the surface, its golden skin contrasting with the dark amber liquid. Tiny droplets of oil from the peel cling to the rim, adding a touch of citrus fragrance to the air. **Describe this cocktail in detail, focusing on the following:*** **The color and clarity of the liquid:** Is it opaque or translucent? Does it have any noticeable layers?* **The appearance of the ice:** Is it cubed, crushed, or a combination of both? How does it interact with the liquid?* **The texture of the lemon peel:** Is it thin and delicate, or thick and rough? How does it affect the overall appearance?* **The lighting and environment:** Does the cocktail appear in a dimly lit bar or a brightly lit patio? What kind of atmosphere does it evoke?**Your description should be evocative and sensory, bringing the Rusty Nail to life in the reader's imagination.** "
