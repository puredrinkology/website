fullname: "The Spice 75 Cocktail"
shortname: "Spice 75"
description: "The Spice 75, a delightful twist on the classic French 75, belongs to the **Champagne Cocktail** family. Its origins likely stem from the Caribbean, where rum and spice combinations were popular, offering a unique twist on the French 75's sophisticated elegance. "
flavor_description: "The Spice 75 bursts with a vibrant citrus kick from the lime juice, balanced by the sweetness of sugar. Warm, aromatic notes of allspice infuse the rum, creating a complex and intriguing base. Champagne adds a bright effervescence and a hint of dryness, while the orange spiral lends a touch of citrusy elegance. The result is a sophisticated and refreshing cocktail, with a playful twist of spice. "
bartender_tips: "Muddle the sugar and allspice with a splash of rum to extract the most flavor.  Don't over-muddle, just until the sugar dissolves and the spices release their aroma.  Use fresh lime juice for a brighter taste.  Top with chilled champagne and garnish with a vibrant orange spiral for visual appeal.  This creates a balanced cocktail with a spicy kick. "
