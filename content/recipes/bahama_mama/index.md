fullname: "The Bahama Mama Cocktail"
shortname: "Bahama Mama"
description: "The Bahama Mama, a tropical concoction bursting with rum, fruit juices, and sweet liqueurs, belongs to the **rum punch** family. It's said to have originated in the 1950s at the **Bahama Beach Club** in Nassau, Bahamas, becoming a popular vacation drink ever since. "
flavor_description: "The Bahama Mama is a tropical explosion of flavors.  The rum base gives it a smooth, boozy warmth, with a hint of caramel from the dark rum.  The banana liqueur adds a creamy sweetness, while the grenadine provides a tart, fruity punch.  Pineapple and orange juices contribute a refreshing citrusy tang, balanced by the sweet and sour mix for a perfectly balanced, decadent cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality dark rum for depth. A splash of banana liqueur adds tropical sweetness, but don't overdo it. Grenadine gives a vibrant red hue and tartness. Balance the sweetness with plenty of pineapple and orange juice.  Shake well with ice to chill thoroughly and use a large glass to show off the vibrant colors. Garnish with a pineapple wedge and cherry for that classic Bahama Mama touch. "
