bartender_tips: "For a balanced Monkey Wrench, fresh grapefruit juice is key. Use\
  \ a good quality light rum, not overly sweet. A few dashes of Angostura bitters\
  \ add complexity, but go easy \u2013 you don't want them to overpower the citrus.\
  \ Shake well with ice to chill and dilute, then strain into a chilled coupe glass.\
  \ A grapefruit wedge garnish adds a nice touch! "
