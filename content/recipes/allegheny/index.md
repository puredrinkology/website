shortname: "Allegheny"
author: "Pure Drinkology"
description: "The Allegheny is a unique twist on the classic Sour family, drawing inspiration from the rich history of American cocktailing. While its origins are debated, it likely emerged in the early 20th century, showcasing the versatility of bourbon and the burgeoning popularity of blackberry brandy. "
flavor_description: "The Allegheny is a complex and balanced cocktail with a dry, herbal forward character. The dry vermouth provides a bitter backbone with notes of spice and citrus. The bourbon adds warmth and spice, while the blackberry brandy contributes sweet, fruity notes. The lemon juice cuts through the richness, offering a refreshing acidity, while the lemon peel enhances the citrus aroma. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Allegheny, chill your glassware beforehand.  Use a good quality dry vermouth, and don't be afraid to go heavy on the blackberry brandy - it's the star of the show.  Freshly squeezed lemon juice is key, and a twist of lemon peel adds an elegant touch.  Shake vigorously with ice to chill thoroughly, then strain into your chilled glass.  Enjoy! "
