bartender_tips: 'Chill your glass and ingredients, especially the Prosecco, for a
  crisp, refreshing experience. Muddle the lime and sugar syrup gently to avoid bitterness.
  Use a good quality white rum with a bit of spice for complexity. Build the cocktail
  in the glass, topping with Prosecco to maintain its effervescence. A twist of lime
  adds a touch of elegance. '

description: 'The Old Cuban is a modern twist on the classic Daiquiri, belonging to
  the sour family of cocktails. Though not a traditional Cuban drink, it is believed
  to have originated in the early 2000s, inspired by the Daiquiri''s Cuban roots and
  the effervescence of Prosecco. '

flavor_description: 'The Old Cuban is a bright and bubbly delight. The white rum provides
  a smooth, slightly sweet base, while the lime juice delivers a tart and refreshing
  zing.  The sugar syrup balances the acidity with a touch of sweetness, and the Angostura
  bitters add a subtle, aromatic complexity. The Prosecco provides a lively effervescence
  that cleanses the palate.  Overall, the Old Cuban is a delicious and sophisticated
  cocktail that''s perfect for any occasion. '
