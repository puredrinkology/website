bartender_tips: For a Pure Passion that explodes with flavor, use fresh lime juice
  and high-quality rum.  Muddle mint gently to release its aroma, but avoid bruising
  it.  Add passion fruit syrup to taste, starting with a small amount and adjusting
  to your preference. A few dashes of peach bitters add complexity, but don't overdo
  it!  Shake hard with ice to chill and combine flavors, then strain into a chilled
  glass.  Garnish with a mint sprig and a lime wheel for a beautiful finish.

flavor_description: 'Pure Passion is a tropical explosion on the palate. The rum''s
  warmth is tempered by the sweet and tangy passion fruit and lime, while the Passoa
  adds a hint of floral complexity.  The peach bitters bring a subtle stone fruit
  note, and the mint offers a refreshing coolness. The overall effect is vibrant,
  balanced, and undeniably delicious. '
