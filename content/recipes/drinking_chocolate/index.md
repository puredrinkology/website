title: "The Drinking Chocolate Cocoa"
fullname: "The Drinking Chocolate Cocoa"
shortname: "Drinking Chocolate"
description: "This isn't a cocktail, but a decadent, warm beverage. It draws inspiration from centuries-old hot chocolate traditions, with the creamy richness and spices echoing European and Latin American recipes. Enjoy it as a comforting treat, not a boozy concoction! "
flavor_description: "Drinking Chocolate is a decadent treat that balances rich, creamy sweetness with warm spice. The heavy cream and milk deliver a velvety texture, while the chocolate adds a deep, luxurious flavor. Cinnamon and vanilla contribute a comforting warmth and complexity, making this a comforting indulgence.  The whipped cream adds a light and airy element, enhancing the overall decadent experience. "
bartender_tips: "To elevate your Drinking Chocolate, use high-quality chocolate and vanilla.  Warm the milk and cream gently to dissolve the chocolate fully, avoiding boiling.  Infuse the cinnamon directly in the warm milk for a deeper flavor.  Don't over-whip the cream, a soft peak is ideal.  Garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon or chocolate shavings for visual appeal. "
