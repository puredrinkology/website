description: "Zippy's Revenge belongs to the Punch family, a historical cocktail category featuring strong spirits, fruit juices, and often a sweetener. Its origin is likely modern, a playful riff on the traditional Rum Punch with a whimsical twist using Kool-Aid as a playful nod to childhood. "
flavor_description: "Zippy's Revenge is a sweet and boozy concoction. The Amaretto adds a rich, almondy sweetness, while the Rum contributes a spicy, rum-forward character. The Kool-Aid brings a vibrant fruity punch, but the exact flavor profile will vary based on the chosen flavor. This is a cocktail best enjoyed on a hot day or as a playful dessert drink. "
bartender_tips: "Zippy's Revenge is a fun, but tricky one.  Start with a good quality Amaretto for sweetness.  Use dark rum for depth, but be careful not to overpower the other flavors.  Kool-Aid is the wildcard - use a strong flavor like Cherry or Tropical Punch.  Shaking is key to blending the flavors, but don't overdo it or you'll dilute the taste.  A splash of club soda helps with fizz and adds a refreshing touch. "
