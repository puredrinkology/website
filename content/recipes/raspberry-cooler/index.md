bartender_tips: 'For a perfectly balanced Raspberry Cooler, use good quality raspberry
  vodka.  Chill it and your soda beforehand for a refreshing experience.  Don''t over-ice
  the drink, just enough to chill the vodka.  A light hand with the soda is key; you
  want the raspberry flavor to shine, not get lost in fizz.  A lemon wedge garnish
  adds a beautiful touch and enhances the citrus notes. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt:Describe the appearance of a Raspberry Cooler cocktail, focusing
  on its color, texture, and any visual elements. The cocktail is made with Raspberry
  Vodka, Lemon-Lime Soda, and ice. Consider the following aspects:* **Color:** Is
  it a vibrant pink, a deep red, or a lighter blush? Is there any variation in color,
  like a gradient or layering?* **Texture:** Is it clear or cloudy? Does it have any
  visible ice chunks or bubbles? Is it thick or thin?* **Visual elements:** Are there
  any garnishes? How does the light interact with the drink (e.g., does it shimmer)?
  **Example:**  Imagine a tall glass filled with a vibrant pink beverage, slightly
  cloudy from the ice and soda. The color fades from a bright pink at the top to a
  more subtle blush at the bottom, creating a beautiful gradient. Tiny bubbles dance
  in the liquid, adding to the lively appearance. A sprig of fresh mint, resting on
  the rim, provides a touch of green and adds a refreshing aroma.  '
