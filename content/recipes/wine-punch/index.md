bartender_tips: 'To elevate your Wine Punch, use a good quality red wine with bright
  fruit notes.  Don''t be afraid to muddle your orange slices for a more intense citrus
  aroma. Freshly squeezed orange juice is a must, and balance the sweetness with a
  splash of pineapple juice. Chill the punch thoroughly for a crisp, refreshing taste.  Serve
  over ice with a garnish of orange and pineapple wedges. '

flavor_description: 'Wine Punch is a vibrant, refreshing cocktail that balances the
  boldness of red wine with citrusy sweetness.  The tartness of lemon and orange juice
  cuts through the wine''s tannins, creating a bright, lively flavor.  The addition
  of orange slices adds a hint of bitterness, while pineapple juice contributes a
  touch of tropical sweetness. The overall effect is a delicious and easy-drinking
  punch that''s perfect for any occasion. '
