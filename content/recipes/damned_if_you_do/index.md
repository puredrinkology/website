description: "The Damned If You Do is a spirited riff on the classic Hot Damn, a high-octane, candy-flavored cocktail popular in the 1980s.  This fiery concoction belongs to the shooter family, known for their quick, potent delivery and often audacious flavor combinations. "
flavor_description: "Damned If You Do is a spicy and sweet cocktail that packs a punch. The whiskey provides a bold and smoky base, while the Hot Damn adds a vibrant cinnamon and chili pepper heat. This combination creates a complex flavor profile that is both warming and invigorating, with a lingering sweetness and spice that lingers on the palate. "
bartender_tips: "This is a fiery combo!  Use high-quality whiskey for a smoother burn.  Chill the Hot Damn beforehand for a refreshing contrast.  Shake hard with ice to dilute slightly and create a frothy top.  Rim the glass with chili powder or cinnamon sugar for a spicy kick.  Garnish with a lime wedge for a bright touch.  "
