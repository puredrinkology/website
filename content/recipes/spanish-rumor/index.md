  \ all you need.  The cherry liqueur adds a touch of sweetness and complexity, but\
  \ be careful not to overpower the other elements.  Chill your ingredients beforehand\

description: 'The Spanish Rumor draws from the classic Manhattan family, a sophisticated
  blend of rye whiskey, sweet vermouth, and a touch of cherry liqueur. Its origins
  are likely rooted in the early 20th century, a time when Manhattan variations were
  popular and kola syrup''s sweetness offered a unique twist. '

flavor_description: 'The Spanish Rumor is a complex and alluring cocktail. The Kola
  Syrup lends a sweet, cola-like note, while the Rye provides a spicy kick. The Sweet
  Vermouth adds a touch of bitterness and herbal complexity, while the Cherry Liqueur
  offers a sweet and fruity counterpoint. The interplay of these flavors creates a
  balanced and intriguing cocktail that is both refreshing and sophisticated. '
