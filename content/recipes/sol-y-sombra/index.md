bartender_tips: For the Sol Y Sombra, use a good quality brandy - it's the star of
  the show. Ensure your anisette is chilled, it'll add a crispness to the cocktail.
  Don't overshake, a gentle stir keeps the brandy's complexity intact.  A lemon twist,
  not a squeeze, gives a subtle citrus note without overwhelming the brandy and anisette.
