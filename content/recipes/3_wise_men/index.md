description: "The 3 Wise Men cocktail, a blend of Jack Daniel's, Johnnie Walker, and Jim Beam, belongs to the **Whiskey Smash** family, known for its simple, straightforward combination of whiskeys. This drink likely originated in the US, a playful nod to the diverse world of whiskey, and the trio of iconic brands. "
flavor_description: "The 3 Wise Men offers a complex and robust flavor profile. The smooth, smoky notes of Jack Daniel's blend harmoniously with the rich, peaty character of Johnnie Walker. Jim Beam's sweet corn and vanilla notes add a touch of warmth and complexity, creating a balanced and satisfying cocktail. It's a bold and adventurous drink for seasoned whiskey enthusiasts. "
bartender_tips: "This is a bold, complex drink so balance is key.  Use high-quality ice to prevent watering down.  Don't overshake - a few gentle shakes will integrate the flavors without bruising the ice.  Taste after each shake and adjust the ratio to your liking.  A touch of bitters can add depth, and a lemon twist for garnish brings a fresh element.  Enjoy! "
