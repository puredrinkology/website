bartender_tips: 'Chill your glass and ingredients beforehand for a super smooth, refreshing
  drink. Use high-quality Irish Cream and Frangelico for the best flavor. Shake vigorously
  with ice to ensure proper emulsification and a creamy texture.  Don''t over-shake,
  as you want the drink to be thick, not watery. Garnish with a chocolate shavings
  or a sprinkle of cinnamon for an extra touch of indulgence. '

flavor_description: 'The Nutty Irishman is a creamy, decadent treat with a balanced
  sweetness.  The Baileys provides a smooth, rich Irish cream base, while the Frangelico
  adds a distinct hazelnut and vanilla note.  A touch of milk mellows the sweetness
  and adds a velvety texture, creating a comforting and luxurious experience.  Think
  of a warm, nutty hug in a glass. '
