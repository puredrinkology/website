flavor_description: "The Stone Sour is a delightful blend of sweet and tart. Apricot brandy brings a warm, fruity sweetness, while orange juice adds a vibrant citrus kick. The sweet and sour mix balances the flavors, resulting in a refreshing and slightly tangy cocktail that is both smooth and complex.  "
bartender_tips: "For a killer Stone Sour, remember these tips: * Use a good quality Apricot Brandy for a richer flavor.* Freshly squeezed orange juice is key, avoid bottled.* Don't be shy with the sweet and sour mix, it balances the tartness.* Shake well with ice for a frosty, refreshing drink.* Garnish with a Luxardo cherry and a twist of orange peel.
