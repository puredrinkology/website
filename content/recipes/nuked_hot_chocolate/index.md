shortname: "Nuked Hot Chocolate"
author: "Pure Drinkology"
description: "Nuked Hot Chocolate is a playful take on the classic Hot Chocolate, a comforting beverage enjoyed for centuries. While its origins are unclear, it likely emerged from the fusion of ancient Aztec cacao drinks and European dairy traditions.  "
flavor_description: "Nuked Hot Chocolate offers a classic, comforting taste.  The cocoa powder provides rich, chocolatey notes, balanced by the sweetness of the sugar.  A subtle hint of vanilla extract adds a touch of warmth and complexity.  The milk provides creaminess and a smooth texture, making it a comforting and satisfying drink. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Nuked Hot Chocolate, focus on quality ingredients. Use Dutch-processed cocoa powder for a richer flavor.  Don't over-sweeten, start with less sugar and adjust to taste.  A splash of vanilla extract elevates the flavor.  Finally, heat the milk gently on the stovetop instead of microwaving for a smoother, creamier texture. "
