fullname: "The Sea Breeze Cocktail"
shortname: "Sea Breeze"
description: "The Sea Breeze is a classic highball, a refreshing blend of vodka, cranberry, and grapefruit juices.  Originating in the 1940s, this pink and tart cocktail likely emerged as a sweeter take on the traditional Vodka and Grapefruit juice cocktail.  "
flavor_description: "The Sea Breeze is a refreshing and tart cocktail. The vodka provides a clean, neutral base, while the cranberry juice delivers a sweet and tart punch. Grapefruit juice adds a subtle bitterness and a touch of citrus, balancing the sweetness and creating a complex flavor profile that is both invigorating and thirst-quenching. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Sea Breeze, use high-quality vodka and fresh-squeezed grapefruit juice for a brighter flavor. Don't over-shake, just a gentle swirl to chill and combine. For a sweeter drink, use less grapefruit juice. Garnish with a lime wedge, grapefruit slice, or a sprig of rosemary for a fresh touch. "

How much can you see through the drink?* **Texture:** Does the drink appear smooth, bubbly, or layered?  Are there any visible ingredients or garnishes? * **Overall impression:** What is the overall aesthetic of the cocktail? Does it look refreshing, elegant, or casual? **Example:**Imagine a tall, chilled glass filled with a vibrant, ruby-red liquid. The color is slightly translucent, hinting at the light pink hue of the grapefruit juice beneath. The surface is smooth and still, perhaps adorned with a single, bright-green lime wedge.  The overall impression is one of refreshing elegance, perfect for a warm summer evening. "
