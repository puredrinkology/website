description: "The Whisky Mac, a simple blend of Scotch whisky and sweet wine, is a member of the wine-based cocktail family.  It's a classic British drink, popularized in the early 20th century, likely originating from Scottish pubs as a quick and flavorful way to enjoy whisky. "
flavor_description: "The Whisky Mac is a balanced and complex drink. The Scotch whisky brings a robust, smoky character, while the sweet vermouth adds notes of dried fruit, spice, and a touch of bitterness. The combination creates a warm and comforting experience with a lingering finish. "
bartender_tips: "The Whisky Mac is a simple yet classic drink, but there are a few tricks to make it shine. Use a good quality Scotch with some age for depth. Opt for a sweet, fortified wine like ruby port or sweet vermouth.  Chill both ingredients beforehand for a refreshing experience.  Shake vigorously with ice to dilute and chill the drink, then strain into a chilled coupe glass. Garnish with a twist of orange peel for a touch of citrus aroma. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Imagine a Whisky Mac, a classic cocktail made with Scotch whisky and sweet vermouth. Describe the drink's appearance in vivid detail. Consider:*** **Color:** Is it a deep amber, a reddish hue, or something in between?* **Clarity:** Is it clear, or does it have a slight cloudiness?* **Texture:** Is it smooth and silky, or does it have a slight oily sheen?* **Ice:** What type of ice is used, and how does it affect the drink's appearance?* **Garnish:** What, if any, garnish is used, and how does it contribute to the overall aesthetic?**Example:** The Whisky Mac, a captivating blend of amber Scotch and ruby vermouth, boasts a deep, rich hue reminiscent of polished mahogany. Its clarity is pristine, with a subtle, almost imperceptible shimmer from the ice.  A large, clear ice cube sits nestled within the chilled glass, melting slowly and releasing a gentle mist.  A twist of orange peel rests elegantly on the rim, offering a fragrant aroma that complements the complex notes of the drink. "
