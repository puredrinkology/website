flavor_description: "Don't Scoff At The Scoff is a complex and intriguing cocktail. The orgeat syrup provides a sweet, almondy base, while the bourbon adds warmth and spice. The mezcal lends a smoky, earthy note, balanced by the subtle bitterness of aromatic and chocolate bitters. The result is a captivating blend of sweet, smoky, spicy, and bitter flavors, creating a truly unique and memorable cocktail experience. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality orgeat syrup, as it's the key ingredient. Measure the orgeat carefully for the right balance. A dash of each bitters adds complexity, but don't overdo it. Shake hard with ice to chill and dilute. Strain into a chilled coupe for a crisp, elegant presentation. "
