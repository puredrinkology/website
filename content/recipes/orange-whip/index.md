bartender_tips: 'For a smooth Orange Whip, use a high-quality rum and vodka.  Ensure
  the cream is chilled for a thick consistency.  Shake vigorously with ice to thoroughly
  chill and blend the flavors.  Strain into a chilled coupe glass for a sophisticated
  presentation. A subtle orange zest garnish adds a fragrant touch. '

  early 20th century. Its exact origin remains shrouded, but it likely emerged from

  fruit flavors with creamy textures. '
