shortname: "Gin Sour"
description: "The Gin Sour is a classic member of the Sour family, a group of cocktails typically made with a spirit, citrus juice, and sweetener. Its origins are murky, but it's likely a variation on the Whiskey Sour, popularized in the 19th century and enjoyed by both bartenders and home drinkers alike. "
flavor_description: "The Gin Sour is a bright and tangy cocktail.  The juniper-forward gin provides a dry, herbal base, balanced by the tartness of lemon juice and sweetness of sugar. A touch of orange zest adds citrusy complexity, while the maraschino cherry brings a playful, slightly sweet note. The overall profile is refreshing, with a tart-sweet finish that leaves you craving another sip. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Gin Sour,  use a good quality gin and fresh lemon juice.  Shake vigorously with ice to chill and emulsify.  Use a bar spoon to gently stir the cocktail before serving.  For a visually appealing presentation, garnish with a lemon twist and a maraschino cherry, resting on the edge of the glass.  "
