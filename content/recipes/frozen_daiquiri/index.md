description: "The Frozen Daiquiri, a refreshing blend of light rum, triple sec, lime juice, sugar, and ice, belongs to the **Daiquiri family**. Originating in the early 20th century in Cuba, the Daiquiri is named after the nearby town of Daiquir√≠, where the drink was first concocted. "
flavor_description: "The Frozen Daiquiri is a tart and refreshing cocktail with a vibrant citrus flavor. The light rum adds a subtle sweetness and a touch of warmth, while the triple sec provides a hint of orange zest. The lime juice gives it a sharp, tangy acidity, balanced by the sweetness of the sugar. The ice creates a smooth, icy texture, making it the perfect summer drink. The cherry garnish adds a playful sweetness and a pop of color. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality light rum for the best flavor.  Freshly squeezed lime juice is key.  Don't be shy with the sugar - it balances the tartness.  For a truly frozen consistency, use a good amount of ice, blend until smooth, and don't over-blend.  A maraschino cherry garnish adds a classic touch. "

visual: "## Frozen Daiquiri Description Prompt:**Imagine a frosty, opaque drink in a chilled glass. The color should be a vibrant, almost fluorescent, shade of lime green, reflecting the light with a subtle shimmer.  Tiny ice crystals cling to the sides of the glass, creating a delicate frost. A single, bright red maraschino cherry sits nestled at the bottom of the glass, adding a splash of color.  The texture is dense and smooth, like a creamy sorbet, with a gentle chill that lingers on the tongue.** **Bonus Prompt:****For added detail, describe the condensation forming on the outside of the glass, making it appear slightly blurry and adding to the overall chilled aesthetic.  Mention how the drink appears to be slightly translucent in certain areas, revealing the faint outline of the cherry at the bottom.** "
