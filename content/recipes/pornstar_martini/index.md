description: "The Pornstar Martini belongs to the modern classic cocktail family, known for bold, fruity flavors. Created by bartender Douglas Ankrah in London during the early 2000s, it features passion fruit, vanilla vodka, and a side of champagne. Its provocative name and vibrant taste have made it a global favorite at contemporary bars."
flavor_description: "The Pornstar Martini is a sweet and tangy tropical delight. The vodka provides a smooth base, while the Passoa liqueur delivers a rich, passionfruit-infused sweetness. Lime juice adds a refreshing acidity, and the passion fruit juice amplifies the tropical fruitiness. The Prosecco topper brings a touch of bubbly effervescence and enhances the overall complexity of the cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "Chill your glasses and all ingredients beforehand.  Use good quality vodka and fresh lime juice for optimal flavor.  Don't overshake the martini, as it will make it cloudy.  Use a fine-mesh strainer to ensure a smooth, clear drink.  A splash of Prosecco before serving adds a delightful fizz.  Enjoy responsibly! "
