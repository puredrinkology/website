description: "The Lone Tree Cocktail is a classic Martini variation, a member of the esteemed gin-based cocktail family.  While its exact origin is shrouded in mystery, its simple elegance points to a likely birth in the late 19th or early 20th century, a time when gin cocktails were all the rage. "
flavor_description: "The Lone Tree Cocktail offers a balanced and complex taste profile. The sweet vermouth provides a rich, slightly bitter base with notes of dried fruits and herbs, while the gin adds a crisp, juniper-forward character. The interplay of these elements creates a harmonious blend of sweetness, bitterness, and herbal complexity. The cocktail finishes with a lingering dryness, leaving a pleasant warmth on the palate. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality gin and a vermouth that's not overly sweet.  Chill your glass beforehand and stir the drink with ice to ensure a perfectly chilled cocktail. Don't over-stir or the gin will become cloudy. Garnish with a lemon twist for a citrusy aroma and a final touch of elegance. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing the Lone Tree Cocktail**Prompt:**Imagine a single, elegant cocktail glass filled with a beautiful amber liquid. The color is a rich, deep hue, reminiscent of the warm glow of a setting sun. Tiny, shimmering bubbles rise slowly from the depths, creating a delicate, ethereal aura. The aroma is complex and intriguing, with hints of bittersweet vermouth and a subtle, earthy note of juniper from the gin. As you lift the glass to your lips, you notice a faint, almost imperceptible, oily film clinging to the rim, hinting at the smooth, velvety texture that awaits. **Describe the appearance of this cocktail in detail, focusing on its color, texture, and any visible elements like bubbles or a rim. Use evocative language and imagery to paint a picture in the reader's mind.** "
