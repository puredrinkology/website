description: "Shooting Blancs belongs to the Sour family, a classic cocktail style characterized by its balance of sweet, sour, and spirit.  While its exact origin is unknown, it's likely a modern twist on the classic Whiskey Sour, drawing inspiration from the contemporary cocktail scene's fascination with unique flavor combinations. "
flavor_description: "Shooting Blancs bursts with a tropical punch from the passionfruit, balanced by the smooth tequila and the spicy kick of Ancho Reyes.  Dry vermouth adds a touch of herbal complexity, while lime juice provides a tart counterpoint.  The grapefruit bitters lend a subtle citrusy bitterness, tying the whole experience together in a vibrant and memorable cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Shooting Blancs, focus on the passionfruit syrup.  Don't go overboard, aim for a subtle sweetness.  Shake hard with ice to chill and dilute properly.  Ancho Reyes brings heat, so adjust based on your preference.  A good grapefruit bitters will round out the citrus notes.  Strain into a chilled coupe and garnish with a grapefruit twist for an extra aromatic kick. "
