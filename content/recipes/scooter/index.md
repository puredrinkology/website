fullname: "The Scooter Cocktail"
shortname: "Scooter"
description: "The Scooter is a creamy cocktail, likely belonging to the Brandy Alexander family, known for its rich, decadent flavors.  While its exact origins are unknown, it likely emerged in the 1970s or 1980s, influenced by the popularity of creamy liqueurs like Amaretto. "
flavor_description: "The Scooter boasts a rich, smooth, and velvety texture. The brandy provides a warm, fruity base, while the amaretto adds a touch of sweet almond and a hint of bitterness. The light cream softens the edges, rounding out the flavors with a touch of richness and creating a comforting and slightly decadent experience. "
bartender_tips: "The Scooter is a creamy, sweet drink that can be easily over-sweetened. To balance the flavors, use a high-quality brandy with a good fruitiness and a well-aged Amaretto.  Don't be afraid to adjust the cream to your liking, but a little goes a long way.  Shake the cocktail vigorously with ice to ensure the ingredients are properly combined and chilled. "
