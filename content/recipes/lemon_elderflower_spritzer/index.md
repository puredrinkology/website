description: "The Lemon Elderflower Spritzer is a refreshing, modern twist on the classic Fizz family.  Its origins are likely rooted in the popularity of elderflower cordial, a European staple, and the growing trend of light, sophisticated cocktails. "
flavor_description: "The Lemon Elderflower Spritzer is a delightful fusion of sweet, tart, and floral notes. The elderflower cordial brings a delicate, floral sweetness, balanced by the sharp acidity of fresh lemon juice. Vodka adds a subtle burn, while the soda water creates a refreshing effervescence. The overall taste is light, crisp, and incredibly refreshing, perfect for a warm day or a celebratory occasion. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality elderflower cordial for best flavor.  Chill all ingredients, including the glass, for optimal refreshment.  Start with a light hand on the vodka, you can always add more! Gently stir the ingredients to avoid diluting the soda water too quickly. Garnish with a lemon wheel or sprig of fresh mint for a touch of elegance.  "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:Imagine a tall, slender glass, filled with a refreshing, light-yellow cocktail. The base is a vibrant, almost neon yellow, hinting at the sweet and floral notes of the elderflower cordial. A thin slice of lemon, carefully placed on the rim, adds a touch of vibrant green, contrasting beautifully with the yellow base. Tiny bubbles from the soda water dance on the surface, creating a subtle effervescence. The glass is frosted on the outside, catching the light and creating a cool, inviting aura. This is the Lemon Elderflower Spritzer, a perfect combination of floral sweetness and citrus acidity, ready to quench your thirst on a warm summer day. "
