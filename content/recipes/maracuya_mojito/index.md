description: "The Maracuya Mojito is a vibrant twist on the classic Cuban Mojito, a refreshing cocktail family born in Havana.  This modern interpretation infuses the traditional rum, lime, and mint with the tropical sweetness of passionfruit syrup, creating a lively and exotic experience. "
flavor_description: "The Maracuya Mojito is a vibrant, tropical delight.  The passionfruit syrup bursts with sweet, tangy notes, mingling with the refreshing coolness of mint and lime. White rum adds a subtle warmth and complexity, creating a balanced flavor profile that is both sweet and tart, with a hint of herbal freshness.  The combination is both invigorating and exotic, perfect for a warm summer evening. "
bartender_tips: "Muddle the mint gently, don't crush it to avoid bitterness.  Use fresh lime juice for the best flavor.  Add the Passionfruit syrup after the rum and lime, as it will balance the sweetness.  Shake vigorously with ice, then strain into a chilled glass. Garnish with a sprig of mint and a lime wheel. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the Appearance of a Maracuya MojitoImagine a tall, frosted glass filled with crushed ice.  The ice is a brilliant, almost translucent white, like fresh snow.  Nestled on top of this frosty bed is a vibrant, emerald green layer of freshly muddled mint leaves, their fragrant aroma wafting up to your nose.  The liquid itself is a mesmerizing blend of sunshine yellow and pale green, reminiscent of a tropical sunset.  Tiny bubbles dance on the surface, whispering of the rum's presence.  A delicate, almost translucent layer of passionfruit syrup coats the rim of the glass, offering a sweet promise of the flavor to come.  A single lime wedge, glistening with condensation, sits perched on the edge, adding a touch of citrusy brightness to the overall composition.  **Focus on:*** The vibrant colors and textures* The clarity of the ice and the liquid* The enticing aromas emanating from the drink * The overall aesthetic appeal and inviting nature of the cocktail.
