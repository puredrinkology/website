description: "The H.D. cocktail belongs to the Coffee Cocktail family. This drink likely emerged in the late 20th century, a product of the growing popularity of Irish Cream liqueurs and coffee-based drinks. It's a simple yet satisfying combination, perfect for a cozy evening. "
flavor_description: "The H.D. offers a complex and layered flavor profile. The whisky provides a bold, smoky foundation, while the Baileys Irish Cream adds a creamy, sweet richness with hints of chocolate and vanilla. The coffee adds a robust, slightly bitter edge, balancing the sweetness and enhancing the whisky's depth. The result is a warm, comforting cocktail with a lingering, slightly sweet finish. "
bartender_tips: "To make a smooth H.D., use good quality whiskey and chilled Baileys.  Start with a rocks glass filled with ice.  Pour the whiskey first, then the Baileys, followed by the coffee. Gently stir to combine, avoiding excessive dilution. Garnish with a coffee bean or a sprinkle of cocoa powder. "

visual: "##  Describe the appearance of a cocktail called H.D., made with Whisky, Baileys Irish Cream, and Coffee. **Consider these details:*** **Color:**  What shade of brown does the cocktail take on? Is it a rich, dark brown, a lighter amber, or something in between? * **Clarity:** Is the cocktail clear or opaque? Does it have any swirls or layers?* **Texture:** Does the cocktail appear creamy, smooth, or perhaps slightly frothy?* **Garnish:**  Is there a garnish on top? If so, describe it. What does it add to the overall visual appeal?**Example Prompt:**Imagine a cocktail, H.D., a blend of rich whiskey, creamy Baileys Irish Cream, and a hint of coffee.  It's a dark, enticing brown, almost like a melted chocolate bar. The liquid is opaque, slightly swirling as the different ingredients mingle.  A gentle, creamy texture crowns the top, perhaps topped with a sprinkle of dark chocolate shavings for a final touch of indulgence. "
