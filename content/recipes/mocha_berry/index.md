description: "The Mocha-Berry belongs to the **Coffee Cocktail** family, a group known for their rich, complex flavors and often served as after-dinner drinks. While its exact origin is unknown, the combination of coffee, chocolate, and raspberry liqueur points to a modern creation inspired by the popularity of coffee-based cocktails and the growing trend of fruit-infused spirits. "
flavor_description: "The Mocha-Berry is a harmonious blend of rich coffee and sweet berry notes.  The Chambord's raspberry and black raspberry flavors intertwine with the coffee's roasted bitterness, creating a delightful complexity.  Cocoa powder adds a subtle chocolate depth, balanced by the smooth, airy whipped cream.  Expect a decadent, slightly tart, and ultimately satisfying experience. "
bartender_tips: "Chill your glass beforehand for a frosty presentation.  Use a good quality coffee, freshly brewed, for the best flavor. When adding Chambord, use a bar spoon to gently swirl it into the coffee for a beautiful marbled effect.  Dust with cocoa powder right before serving, ensuring a fresh, unclumped coating. A light touch with the whipped cream is key â€“ you want it to compliment, not overwhelm the other flavors. "
