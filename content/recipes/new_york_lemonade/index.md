shortname: "New York Lemonade"
description: "The New York Lemonade belongs to the Sour family, a classic cocktail style characterized by a base spirit, citrus juice, and a sweetener. While its exact origins are unclear, its bright, refreshing nature likely draws inspiration from the 19th-century New York bar scene. "
flavor_description: "The New York Lemonade is a bright and refreshing cocktail. The Absolut Citron provides a crisp, citrusy base, while the Grand Marnier adds a touch of orange sweetness and a hint of cognac complexity. The tart lemon juice balances the sweetness, and the club soda adds a light and bubbly texture. Overall, the cocktail is a perfect blend of sweet, tart, and bubbly, with a subtle orange-citrus aroma. "
bartender_tips: "To make a truly refreshing New York Lemonade, start by chilling all your ingredients. Use fresh lemon juice for the best flavor.  Shake vigorously with ice to ensure a frosty, well-combined drink. Don't over-pour the Grand Marnier - you want a subtle orange flavor, not a cloying sweetness.  Top with club soda for a bubbly finish. "
