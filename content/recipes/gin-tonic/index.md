bartender_tips: 'Use a large, chilled glass filled with ice. Pour in gin first, followed
  by tonic. A good ratio is 2 oz gin to 4 oz tonic. Gently stir, then express lemon
  peel oils over the drink and drop it in. Don''t over-garnish, the lemon peel is
  key to the aroma. '

description: 'The Gin Tonic belongs to the Highball family, characterized by a strong
  spirit base topped with a carbonated mixer. Its origin dates back to the 19th century
  in British India, where gin was mixed with tonic water, originally used to treat
  malaria. '
family: highball
flavor_description: 'The Gin Tonic is a classic for a reason. It''s a refreshing blend
  of juniper-forward gin''s botanicals, the bitter sweetness of tonic water, and a
  touch of citrus from the lemon peel. The ice chills the drink, creating a crisp,
  clean palate cleanser with a lingering bitterness and a hint of floral aroma. '

visual: '## Prompt:Describe the appearance of a classic Gin Tonic. Imagine a tall,
  slender glass filled with ice. The gin, clear and crisp, sits nestled among the
  ice cubes. What does the tonic water look like as it is poured in?  Is it clear,
  or does it have a subtle hint of color? How does the lemon peel garnish affect the
  overall appearance?  Consider the light reflecting off the ice and the condensation
  forming on the glass. '
