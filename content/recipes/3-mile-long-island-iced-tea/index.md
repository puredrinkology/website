bartender_tips: 'This is a deceptively potent drink.  Don''t be fooled by the tea
  name; it''s a serious cocktail.  Use a good quality soda for best results.  Be precise
  with measurements, as adding too much of one spirit can make the drink unbalanced.  A
  good bartender will know how to balance all of the flavors and create a delicious
  and potent cocktail. '

description: 'The 3-Mile Long Island Iced Tea is a potent member of the Long Island
  Iced Tea family, known for its multiple spirits. Originating in the 1970s, this
  cocktail''s name likely refers to its ability to make a long journey seem short,
  though its origins are debated. '
family: highball
flavor_description: 'This cocktail is a boozy beast, a punch to the palate.  The citrusy
  sweetness of Triple Sec and sweet and sour mingle with the strong kick of gin, rum,
  tequila, and vodka. Coca-Cola adds a touch of sweetness and the bitterness of Angostura
  bitters cuts through the sugary notes. It''s a complex blend of sweet, sour, and
  bitter, with a strong alcoholic bite.  Be warned, this one packs a punch! '
