title: "Gin Rickey"
description: "The Gin Rickey is a refreshing, classic highball, named after its creator, Colonel Rickey. Its origins lie in the late 19th century, when Colonel Rickey, a Washington, D.C. socialite, requested a simple gin and soda water drink with a squeeze of lime. "
flavor_description: "The Gin Rickey is a refreshingly tart and crisp cocktail. Gin's juniper notes shine through, balanced by the tartness of lemon and lime. A subtle sweetness from grenadine adds a touch of complexity, while the soda water provides a clean and bubbly finish. It's a light and invigorating drink, perfect for warm weather. "
bartender_tips: "A Gin Rickey is a refreshing classic, but it's easy to get wrong.  Use a good quality gin, and fresh-squeezed lime juice for the best flavor.  The grenadine is a subtle touch, just a splash for a hint of sweetness.  Chill the glass beforehand, and top with club soda, not tonic.  Garnish with a lime wheel and a sprig of mint for an extra touch of elegance. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the Gin RickeyImagine a tall, frosted glass filled with a clear, sparkling liquid.  The liquid is a pale, almost translucent, shade of pink, with tiny bubbles dancing on the surface.  A single lime wedge, sliced thin and gently twisted, rests on the rim of the glass, adding a touch of vibrant green.  The gin, clear and strong, provides a subtle backbone to the refreshing drink, while the grenadine, a delicate red syrup, imparts a subtle sweetness and a rosy hue.  The soda water, effervescent and lively, adds a touch of fizziness and lightness to the final product.  Describe this visual scene in detail, focusing on the interplay of colors, textures, and the overall impression of the Gin Rickey.  What emotions does this drink evoke in you?  Is it elegant, playful, refreshing, or all of the above? "
