description: "The 252 is a potent rum-bourbon highball, likely hailing from the American South in the mid-20th century. It's a straightforward, high-proof concoction reflecting the era's fondness for strong, unfussy drinks. "
flavor_description: "The 252 is a boozy, punchy cocktail that throws a fiery punch of 151 proof rum and Wild Turkey bourbon. Expect a strong, sweet, and smoky flavor profile with hints of vanilla and caramel from the bourbon. The high proof rum provides a burn and the wild turkey adds a touch of spice. This is not for the faint of heart, but for those who appreciate a potent and intense cocktail experience. "
bartender_tips: "The 252 is a potent concoction, so approach it with respect. * **Chill everything:**  Ice-cold ingredients are key for a refreshing drink. * **Use a good quality 151 Proof Rum:** This is the star of the show.* **Measure accurately:**  The high alcohol content makes precise measurements essential. * **Shake vigorously:**  A strong shake creates a well-balanced and chilled cocktail. * **Garnish simply:** A lime wedge or cherry adds a touch of elegance.

How does the glass shape impact the appearance of the drink?* **Garnish:** Are there any garnishes used in the cocktail? If so, describe them in detail and explain how they contribute to the overall look.* **Overall Impression:** What is the overall impression of the drink's appearance? Is it elegant, rustic, or something else entirely? **Example:**The 252 is a fiery concoction that boasts a deep amber hue, reminiscent of polished mahogany.  Its viscous texture, slightly oily to the touch, leaves a subtle sheen on the glass. Served in a classic rocks glass, the drink's color is further enhanced by the ice cubes that clink against the glass, creating a mesmerizing dance of light and shadow.  A single orange peel, curled into a delicate spiral, rests on the rim, its vibrant orange contrasting with the dark amber of the drink and adding a touch of sophistication.  Overall, the 252 is a visually striking cocktail, its rustic beauty hiding the potent power within. "
