bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Lassi, use **full-fat yogurt** for richness. **Freshly
  ground cumin** provides the most flavor, so grind it yourself. **Chill everything**
  before blending to ensure a cool, refreshing drink. Use a **powerful blender** to
  achieve a smooth consistency. Adjust the **water and salt** to your taste preference,
  and don''t forget the **mint garnish** for a beautiful finish! '

description: 'The Lassi, a South Indian staple, isn''t a cocktail in the traditional
  sense but rather a refreshing beverage. It belongs to the family of yogurt-based
  drinks, similar to buttermilk or kefir.  Its origins trace back to ancient India,
  where it was enjoyed for its cooling and digestive properties. '

  touch, making this a perfect summer drink. '
