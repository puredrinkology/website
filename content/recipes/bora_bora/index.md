description: "The Bora Bora is a vibrant tropical cocktail belonging to the **Sour family**. Though its exact origin is unknown, it likely emerged in the 1980s, capturing the essence of Polynesian paradise with its bright, tangy flavors. "
flavor_description: "The Bora Bora is a vibrant tropical cocktail that bursts with sunshine flavors. The sweet pineapple and passion fruit blend harmoniously, offering a tropical fruit punch that's balanced by the tartness of lemon.  The grenadine adds a subtle touch of sweetness and a lovely ruby hue, creating a refreshing and visually appealing drink. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Bora Bora, use fresh-squeezed juices whenever possible.  Don't over-shake the cocktail; you want a gentle mix to preserve the delicate flavors. A good tip is to pre-chill the juices and your mixing glass to ensure a refreshing, cold drink.  A rim of sugar or a small pineapple wedge adds a nice touch. "
