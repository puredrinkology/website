shortname: "Empellón Cocinas Fat-Washed Mezcal"
author: "Pure Drinkology"
description: "This cocktail belongs to the **Coffee & Chocolate** family, a sub-genre of the **Digestif** category.  Its origins trace back to the 19th century, where coffee and chocolate liqueurs were popular after-dinner drinks.  This modern twist uses mezcal, a smoky spirit, to add a distinctive touch. "
flavor_description: "This cocktail is a rich and complex experience. The smoky, earthy Mezcal is balanced by the sweetness of the chocolate and coffee liqueurs. Expect notes of dark chocolate, espresso, and a hint of spice, all wrapped in a velvety, full-bodied texture.  The fat-washing process adds a buttery smoothness that lingers on the palate. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality mezcal with smoky notes to complement the chocolate and coffee flavors. Don't over-shake the cocktail as you want to preserve the mezcal's smoky aroma.  Use a high-quality chocolate liqueur like crème de cacao for a rich, decadent flavor. Consider using a coffee liqueur with a complex flavor profile to add depth to the cocktail. Garnish with a chocolate shavings or a coffee bean to enhance the aromatic experience. "

    measure: "0.75 oz"
  - item: "Coffee Liqueur"

instructions:
  - item: "To ensure that your pork fat is just as delicious as theirs, here’s their adobo marinade and what to do with it (you’ll also need a rack of ribs):."
  - item: "4 ancho chiles, 8 guajillo chiles and 4 chipotle chiles, plus 4 cloves roasted garlic, half a cup of cider vinegar, a quarter teaspoon of Mexican oregano, 1 teaspoon of ground black pepper, a whole clove, a quarter teaspoon of ground cinnamon and a half teaspoon of ground cumin."
  - item: "Toast the dried chiles and soak in water for at least an hour until they are rehydrated."
  - item: "Drain and discard the soaking liquid."
  - item: "Combine the soaked chiles with the remaining ingredients and purée until smooth."
  - item: "Cold smoke a rack of baby back pork ribs by taking a large hotel pan with woodchips on one side and charcoal on the other."
  - item: "Place another, smaller, pan with pork ribs, above the charcoal/woodchip pan."
  - item: "Ignite the charcoal, being careful to not ignite the woodchips."
  - item: "Cover both pans with foil and allow to smoke for 10-15 minutes, until desired level of smoke is achieved, then coat with adobo marinade and wrap in tin foil prior to placing ribs in a 300 degree oven for 7 hours."
  - item: "When the ribs have cooled, strain off the fat and use for the infusion."
  - item: "If you’re having a hard time coming up to the same kind of volume of fat, make up the balance with pork lard from a butcher."
  - item: "To get the same depth of flavor without the ribs, heat up the fat in a pot with a few spoons of the marinade."
  - item: "Once you’ve got your tub of seasoned pork fat in cooled liquid form, pour equal amounts of Ilegal Joven mezcal and fat into a sealable container."
  - item: "Seal the container and give it a really good shake, then put it in the freezer overnight."
  - item: "When the whole thing is separated and congealed, pour it through a fine mesh chinoise."
  - item: "If you don’t have a chinoise, try a fine mesh strainer, or if you don’t have one of those, try spooning off most of the fat."
  - item: "There will be some beads of orange fat left in the strained mezcal: run that through a few layers of cheesecloth (or coffee filters in a pinch) to get rid of the last of it."
  - item: "The mezcal is now ready for drinking, straight-up or in a cocktail."
  - item: "Habanero tincture."
  - item: "Slice habaneros and add 2 ounces Ilegal Joven mezcal."
  - item: "Allow to sit overnight or until desired level of heat is achieved."
  - item: "Cocktail."
  - item: "Combine mezcal and chocolate liqueur in a mixing glass with ice and stir for 45 seconds."
  - item: "Strain into chilled coupe."

visual: "## LLM Prompt: **Imagine a cocktail called Empellón Cocina's Fat-Washed Mezcal. It's made with Mezcal, Chocolate Liqueur, and Coffee Liqueur. Describe its appearance in detail, focusing on the color, texture, and any garnishes.** **Consider these elements:*** **Mezcal's smoky character:** How might this affect the color and aroma? * **Chocolate liqueur's richness:**  Does the color lean towards brown or black? Is there any sheen or viscosity?* **Coffee liqueur's depth:** Does it contribute to the overall darkness or create layers of color?* **Garnish options:** What would be the best way to enhance the visual appeal? **Example:**The Empellón Cocina's Fat-Washed Mezcal is a captivating cocktail with a deep amber hue, reminiscent of aged oak. The smooth, almost oily texture suggests the presence of fat-washing, while tiny, shimmering bubbles rise from the depths, hinting at the smoky character of the Mezcal. A thin layer of chocolate foam crowns the drink, its rich brown tones reflecting the subtle sweetness of the chocolate liqueur. A sprig of rosemary, its aromatic needles piercing the foam, adds a touch of elegance and complexity. "
