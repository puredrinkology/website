bartender_tips: 'Use high-quality gin for a truly vibrant flavor. When layering the
  Chartreuses, pour the Yellow Chartreuse first to create a beautiful visual effect.  Use
  a chilled coupe or martini glass to enhance the presentation. Finally, a light garnish
  with a lemon twist or a sprig of rosemary complements the flavors without overwhelming
  them. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt:**Imagine a cocktail named Jewel of the Nile. It''s crafted
  using gin, green Chartreuse, and yellow Chartreuse. Describe the appearance of this
  cocktail, focusing on the color, clarity, and any visual elements that might stand
  out.** **Constraints:*** **The drink is well-balanced and elegant, not overly sweet
  or brightly colored.*** **Consider the unique visual qualities of Chartreuse - its
  vibrant green and yellow hues.*** **The gin''s presence should be subtle, but its
  botanicals may impart subtle nuances to the color.****Example Output:**The Jewel
  of the Nile shimmers in the glass, its hue a captivating blend of jade green and
  golden amber. The layers of Chartreuse create a mesmerizing depth, with the vibrant
  green of the green Chartreuse gently fading into the luminous yellow of its counterpart.
  The gin, while discreet, adds a subtle complexity to the overall tone, hinting at
  the botanicals that lie within. The drink''s clarity is pristine, allowing the intricate
  play of colors to captivate the eye. It''s a cocktail that whispers of ancient secrets
  and the allure of faraway lands. '
