description: "The Pegu Club, a classic gin sour, hails from the legendary Pegu Club in Burma (present-day Myanmar). It's a member of the sour family, where citrus juices and a sweetener are balanced by the spirit, in this case, gin.  "
flavor_description: "The Pegu Club offers a vibrant and complex taste profile. The gin provides a crisp, juniper-forward base, while the orange curaçao adds a sweet, citrusy complexity. Lime juice brings a tart, refreshing acidity, balanced by the subtle bitterness of both Angostura and orange bitters. The interplay of these flavors creates a refreshing, slightly bitter, and ultimately harmonious experience. "
bartender_tips: "When making a Pegu Club, prioritize fresh lime juice for that bright acidity.  Use a good quality gin for the base, and don't skimp on the bitters! A few dashes of both Angostura and orange bitters will add complexity and balance the sweetness of the Curaçao.  Shake with ice until well-chilled, and strain into a chilled coupe for a classic presentation.  Enjoy! "
