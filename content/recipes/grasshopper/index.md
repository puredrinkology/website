It boasts a vibrant, minty sweetness from the Green Creme de Menthe, balanced by the rich, chocolatey notes of Creme de Cacao. The light cream adds a velvety texture and mellows the sweetness, resulting in a smooth and creamy finish. The overall taste profile is a delightful fusion of sweet mint, chocolate, and a hint of creaminess. "
