title: The Shot-Gun Shot
visual: '## LLM Prompt for Describing the Shot-gun Cocktail:**Imagine a shot glass
  filled with a deep amber liquid, its color a rich blend of honey and oak.  The surface
  shimmers with a slight oily sheen, catching the light and reflecting a thousand
  tiny rainbows.  Beneath the surface, subtle swirls of brown and gold dance, hinting
  at the complex interplay of flavors within.  The aroma is potent, a heady mix of
  vanilla, caramel, and spice, with a hint of smokiness lingering in the air.  Describe
  the visual and olfactory experience of this cocktail, paying close attention to
  the specific nuances of each component (Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, Wild Turkey) as
  they contribute to the overall appearance and aroma. ** '
