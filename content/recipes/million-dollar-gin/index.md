bartender_tips: 'For a Million Dollar Gin, chilling your ingredients beforehand is
  key. Use high-quality gin and vermouth for a smoother, more complex taste. Shake
  vigorously with ice to ensure proper dilution and a frosty finish. Don''t over-pour
  the grenadine; a splash is all you need for a beautiful color gradient. Garnish
  with a pineapple wedge and a maraschino cherry for a classic touch. '

description: 'The Million Dollar Gin is a twist on the classic Gin Sour, a cocktail
  family known for its tart, refreshing balance of gin, citrus, and sweetener.  Its
  origins remain unclear, but it likely emerged in the mid-20th century as a playful
  take on the classic, incorporating tropical pineapple and vibrant grenadine. '

flavor_description: 'The Million Dollar Gin is a delightful blend of sweet and tart.
  The gin''s juniper notes dance with the sweetness of the vermouth and pineapple
  juice, creating a harmonious base. A touch of grenadine adds a delicate floral sweetness
  and a vibrant red hue. The overall taste profile is refreshing, slightly fruity,
  and balanced, with a subtle gin backbone that lingers on the palate. '
