fullname: "The Kool First Aid Shot"
shortname: "Kool First Aid"
description: "Kool First Aid belongs to the Jungle Juice family, a category of potent, often homemade, punch-like cocktails popular in the 1970s and 80s.  This specific concoction likely arose from college parties and dorm rooms, a testament to the ingenuity of budget-minded drinkers. "
flavor_description: "Kool First Aid is a punchy, high-proof cocktail with a distinct Kool-Aid sweetness. The 151 proof rum delivers a powerful burn, amplified by the sugary Kool-Aid. Expect notes of artificial fruit flavor, a heavy sweetness, and a long, fiery finish.  The combination is both playful and potent, making it a risky but memorable choice. "
bartender_tips: "**Kool First Aid Tips:*** **Use high-quality rum:** 151 proof is strong, so a good rum will shine through.* **Experiment with Kool-Aid flavors:**  Cherry, blue raspberry, and grape work well.* **Start with a small amount of Kool-Aid:** You can always add more.* **Shake well with ice:** This chills the drink and dilutes it slightly.* **Garnish with a lime wedge or cherry:** For a touch of color and flavor."
