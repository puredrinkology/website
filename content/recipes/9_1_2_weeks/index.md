description: "The 9 1/2 Weeks cocktail, with its citrusy base and fruit liqueurs, belongs to the **Sour family**, a classic cocktail style originating in the 18th century. It likely emerged from the American bar scene, combining the tartness of citrus with the sweetness of liqueurs and the refreshing touch of fruit juice. "
flavor_description: "The 9 1/2 Weeks cocktail offers a vibrant and refreshing experience.  Absolut Citron's citrus notes dance with the sweetness of orange cura√ßao and strawberry liqueur, creating a delightful fruity harmony.  A touch of tartness from orange juice adds balance, resulting in a sweet and tangy cocktail that's perfect for a warm evening.  Think of a summer sunset captured in a glass. "
bartender_tips: "When crafting the 9 1/2 Weeks, prioritize fresh, quality ingredients. Chill your Absolut Citron and orange juice beforehand for a crisp, refreshing drink. Shake vigorously with ice to ensure proper dilution and a smooth texture. A delicate balance is key: use a light hand with the strawberry liqueur for a subtle sweetness, and adjust the curacao to your liking. Garnish with a strawberry slice or orange twist for a vibrant touch. "
