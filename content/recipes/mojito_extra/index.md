shortname: "Mojito Extra"
description: "The Mojito Extra belongs to the Highball family, known for their tall, refreshing nature.  It's a riff on the classic Cuban Mojito, featuring the same core ingredients - mint, lime, rum, and soda - but with the addition of Angostura Bitters for a complex, aromatic twist. "
flavor_description: "The Mojito Extra is a refreshing and invigorating cocktail. Its taste profile features a vibrant mint and citrus burst, balanced by the smooth sweetness of dark rum. The addition of Angostura bitters adds a subtle complexity with notes of spice and herbs, while the club soda provides a crisp and effervescent finish.  "
bartender_tips: "Muddle the mint gently, don't pulverize it. Use fresh lime juice, not bottled. A good quality dark rum is essential.  Add the club soda just before serving to keep the fizz.  A dash of bitters balances the sweetness and adds complexity.  Garnish with a mint sprig and a lime wheel. "

visual: "##  LLM Prompt:**Imagine a tall, clear glass filled with ice. The glass is rimmed with sugar, and the ice is partially submerged in a vibrant, emerald green liquid. Tiny bubbles rise from the depths of the glass, creating a playful, swirling effect.  A sprig of fresh mint, with delicate leaves still clinging to the stem, rests on the edge of the glass, its aroma mingling with the sweet, citrusy scent of the drink.  A single, ruby-red dash of Angostura Bitters adorns the surface, creating a beautiful contrast against the green and white of the drink.  Describe this scene in vivid detail, highlighting the colors, textures, and aromas that contribute to the visual appeal of the Mojito Extra.** "
