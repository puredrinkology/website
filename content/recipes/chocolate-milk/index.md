bartender_tips: 'For the perfect Chocolate Milk, use high-quality chocolate liqueur
  for a rich, complex flavor.  Chill the milk beforehand for a smoother, creamier
  texture. Shake vigorously with ice to emulsify the ingredients and create a frothy
  top. Adjust sweetness to taste with a touch more Amaretto. Garnish with a chocolate
  curl or sprinkle for an elegant touch. '

description: 'Chocolate Milk belongs to the **Creamy Cocktail** family, known for
  their rich textures and often sweet profiles.  While its exact origin is obscure,
  its blend of chocolate liqueur, milk, and Amaretto suggests a playful nod to both
  classic dessert flavors and the Italian tradition of mixing milk with spirits. '

flavor_description: 'Chocolate Milk is a decadent, creamy delight. The chocolate liqueur
  provides a rich, bittersweet cocoa flavor, balanced by the sweetness of the amaretto.
  The milk adds a smooth, velvety texture and rounds out the flavors, creating a comforting,
  almost nostalgic taste reminiscent of a childhood treat. This cocktail is best enjoyed
  on a cold evening or as a special treat after dinner. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt for Chocolate Milk Cocktail Description:**Imagine a glass filled
  with a rich, velvety liquid. The color is reminiscent of dark chocolate, with subtle
  hints of caramel peeking through. The surface is smooth, almost silky, with a faint
  layer of froth that catches the light, making it shimmer slightly. Tiny bubbles
  rise slowly from the bottom, creating a delicate, swirling effect. The aroma is
  intoxicating, a blend of sweet chocolate, toasted almonds, and a touch of vanilla.**
  **Describe this cocktail in detail, paying special attention to its color, texture,
  and the way light interacts with it.  Include details about the aroma and any visible
