description: "The Veteran belongs to the **Old Fashioned** cocktail family, known for its simplicity and bold flavors. This drink likely originated in the **late 19th or early 20th century**, during the golden age of cocktails, when rum and cherry brandy were popular ingredients. "
flavor_description: "The Veteran offers a robust and complex flavor profile. The dark rum provides a rich, molasses-forward base with notes of caramel and spice. The cherry brandy adds a sweet and tart counterpoint, highlighting the rum's depth with fruity, cherry and almond nuances. The combination creates a balanced and satisfying cocktail, both smooth and intriguing. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Veteran, use high-quality dark rum with rich molasses notes. Cherry brandy adds sweetness, so adjust the amount based on your preference. Don't over-shake; a light stir maintains the elegant layering. Garnish with a Luxardo cherry or a brandied cherry for a sophisticated touch. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the Veteran CocktailImagine a dimly lit bar, the air thick with the scent of pipe tobacco and aged wood. A seasoned bartender, his hands weathered and worn, expertly crafts a cocktail. He pours a generous measure of **dark rum**, its molasses-rich hue reflecting the flickering candlelight. He follows with a splash of **cherry brandy**, the vibrant red contrasting beautifully with the rum's deep amber. As the two liquids mingle, a subtle gradient emerges, the top layer a rich mahogany, fading into a warm reddish-brown. The surface shimmers with tiny bubbles, the remnants of a gentle stir. A single, plump **maraschino cherry** rests atop the concoction, its scarlet hue adding a final touch of vibrancy. **Describe this cocktail, The Veteran, capturing the essence of its color, texture, and ambiance.** "
