bartender_tips: 'For a perfect Cuba Libre, start with high-quality dark rum. Muddle
  the lime wedge directly in the glass for maximum freshness, not just juice. Use
  good quality cola, the sweetness balances the rum perfectly. Fill with ice and top
  with cola, gently stirring to avoid diluting the rum. Garnish with a lime wheel
  and enjoy! '

description: 'The Cuba Libre, a member of the Highball family, boasts a simple yet
  invigorating blend. Born in Havana, Cuba, during the early 20th century, this iconic
  cocktail was initially a celebratory drink for the liberation of Cuba from Spanish
  rule. '
family: highball
flavor_description: 'The Cuba Libre is a refreshing and balanced cocktail. The dark
  rum provides a rich, molasses-forward sweetness, while the lime juice adds a tart
  and citrusy counterpoint. Coca-Cola contributes a touch of caramel sweetness and
  a hint of spice, while the ice chills the drink and dilutes it for a smooth finish.
  Expect a slightly sweet, fruity, and slightly spicy experience with a hint of cola
  complexity. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a Cuba Libre cocktail. **Imagine
  a tall, frosted glass filled with ice. The amber glow of dark rum shines through
  the chilled Coca-Cola, creating a layered effect. Tiny bubbles rise from the depths,
  bringing a refreshing fizz to the surface. A wedge of lime rests on the rim, its
  vibrant green color contrasting beautifully with the dark depths of the drink. The
  overall effect is a refreshing, vibrant, and slightly mischievous cocktail, perfect
  for a hot summer day.** '
