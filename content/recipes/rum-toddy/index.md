bartender_tips: 'Use high-quality dark rum for a richer flavor. Don''t skimp on the
  lemon peel - a generous twist releases the most citrus oils. Use hot water, but
  not boiling, to dissolve the sugar and prevent the rum from burning. Stir, don''t
  shake, to avoid diluting the rum.  A good rum toddy should be warm and comforting,
  not overly sweet. '

description: 'The Rum Toddy belongs to the Hot Toddy family, a comforting warm drink
  popular for centuries. Originating in the 18th century, its origins are debated,
  with some attributing it to British sailors, others to the Irish. The name toddy
  likely comes from the Hindi word for palm wine. '

flavor_description: 'The Rum Toddy is a warm and comforting cocktail. The rum provides
  a sweet and boozy base, balanced by the tartness of the lemon peel. The powdered
  sugar adds a touch of sweetness, while the hot water creates a gentle warmth that
  soothes the throat. Expect a rich and complex flavor profile, with hints of citrus,
  spice, and caramel. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt for Rum Toddy Description:**Please describe the appearance
  of a Rum Toddy, considering the following:*** **Base:** A warm, amber-colored liquid,
  likely with a slight cloudiness from the sugar.* **Glass:** Typically served in
  a heat-resistant mug or glass.* **Garnish:** A thin lemon peel, possibly twisted
  or curled, floating on the surface. * **Other details:** Mention if there is any
  condensation on the outside of the glass, or any steam rising from the warm drink.
  **Example:**Imagine a steaming mug filled with a rich, amber-hued liquid. The warm,
  inviting glow is slightly muted by a gentle cloudiness from the dissolved sugar.
  A delicate lemon peel, twisted and curled, sits atop the surface, releasing a subtle
  citrus aroma. Condensation forms on the outside of the mug, hinting at the comforting
  heat within. '
