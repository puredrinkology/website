bartender_tips: 'When making the Deep South, ensure your peach syrup is fresh and
  flavorful.  Use a good quality mezcal for smokiness, and balance the rye with a
  quality, tart lemon juice.  Shake hard with ice to chill thoroughly, and double-strain
  for a pristine presentation.  Garnish with a lemon twist or a fresh peach slice. '

title: The Deep South Cocktail
visual: '## LLM Prompt: **Imagine a cocktail called Deep South in a coupe glass. It''s
  made with Peach Syrup, Mezcal, Rye Whiskey, and Lemon Juice. Describe its appearance
  in detail, focusing on its color, clarity, texture, and any garnishes that might
  be present.****Here are some additional guidelines:*** **Color:**  Is it a vibrant
  orange, a smoky amber, or a subtle blush? * **Clarity:**  Is it crystal clear, slightly
  cloudy, or hazy?* **Texture:**  Is it smooth and silky, or does it have a slight
  oily sheen?* **Garnishes:**  What would be the perfect garnish for this cocktail?
  Consider ingredients that complement the flavors, add visual appeal, and evoke the
  Deep South theme. **Example:** The Deep South shimmers in the coupe glass, a vibrant
  amber tinged with a subtle peach blush. The cocktail is clear, with a slight oily
  sheen, and a delicate layer of foam rests atop. A thin slice of candied peach, studded
  with a single clove, adorns the rim, adding a touch of sweetness and spice to the
  visual. '
