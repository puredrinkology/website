fullname: "The Turkeyball Shot"
shortname: "Turkeyball"
description: "The Turkeyball, a blend of Wild Turkey bourbon, Amaretto, and pineapple juice, belongs to the **Whiskey Sour family**. This simple, refreshing cocktail likely originated in the late 20th century, a product of the American cocktail renaissance that embraced both classic and new combinations. "
flavor_description: "The Turkeyball delivers a bold and sweet punch. Wild Turkey's robust bourbon character shines through, tempered by the nutty sweetness of amaretto.  Pineapple juice adds a bright tropical element, creating a balanced blend of sweet, tangy, and spicy notes that's both refreshing and satisfying. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Turkeyball, use a good quality Wild Turkey bourbon.  Don't be afraid to shake it hard with ice - this chills the drink and helps integrate the flavors.  The pineapple juice should be fresh, not overly sweet.  If you're looking for a more robust flavor, experiment with adding a dash of bitters. Finally, garnish with a pineapple wedge or cherry for a festive touch. "
