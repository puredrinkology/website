flavor_description: "The Kool-Aid Slammer is a sweet and tangy punch. The Kool-Aid's familiar fruity flavor is amplified by the vodka, creating a playful, slightly tart base.  It's a nostalgic, light-hearted drink that's best enjoyed on a warm day with friends. The alcohol's presence is subtle but noticeable, making it a refreshing and easy-to-drink cocktail. "
bartender_tips: "The Kool-Aid Slammer is a classic for a reason!  Here's how to make it great: * Use good quality vodka, it makes a difference. * Chill the Kool-Aid and vodka beforehand for a refreshing drink. * Make it strong enough, but not too strong - a good 2:1 ratio of Kool-Aid to vodka is ideal. * Don't forget the ice! Keep it cold and don't overfill the glass.* You can rim the glass with sugar for a fun touch. "
