description: "The 24k Nightmare shot is a potent member of the layered shooter family, known for its strong, bold flavors. This intense drink combines Goldschläger's cinnamon heat, Jägermeister's herbal complexity, Rumple Minze's peppermint chill, and Bacardi 151's high-proof kick. It likely emerged in the modern bar scene, catering to thrill-seekers looking for a powerful, memorable shot."
flavor_description: "The 24k Nightmare is a potent concoction. It's a fiery explosion of cinnamon and spice from the Goldschlager and Jägermeister, with a minty kick from the Rumple Minze. The 151 Proof Rum adds a potent, boozy heat that lingers on the palate. Overall, it's a bold, aggressive cocktail not for the faint of heart. "
bartender_tips: "This drink is potent!  Start with a chilled rocks glass.  Pour Goldschlager first, then Jägermeister, followed by Rumple Minze.  Top with the 151 Rum, but go slow!  A little goes a long way.  Garnish with a lime wedge for a touch of brightness, and be sure to have a straw for a smoother sip.  Enjoy responsibly! "
