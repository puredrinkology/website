description: "The 57 Chevy with a White License Plate is a delightful twist on the classic **Creme de Cacao cocktail family**.  Its origins are likely contemporary, drawing inspiration from the smooth, sweet-and-spicy flavor profile of its ancestors, while incorporating the modern preference for vodka's clean, crisp finish. "
flavor_description: "The 57 Chevy with a White License Plate is a creamy, smooth cocktail with a hint of nostalgia. The Creme de Cacao provides a rich chocolate flavor, balanced by the clean, crisp taste of vodka. The result is a decadent, slightly sweet experience that's both sophisticated and approachable. Think chocolate-covered cherries with a subtle kick, perfect for a night out or a cozy evening at home. "
bartender_tips: "When making the 57 Chevy with a White License Plate, using a high-quality Cr√®me de Cacao is key for its rich chocolate flavor. Ensure the vodka is chilled for a crisp taste.  Use a cocktail shaker filled with ice and shake vigorously for 15 seconds to properly chill the drink. Strain into a chilled martini glass and garnish with a chocolate curl or a cherry for an elegant touch.  "
