bartender_tips: 'Use a good quality dark rum for a rich flavor. Brew strong coffee,
  ideally with a French press, and let it cool completely before mixing.  Chill the
  rum and water beforehand.  For the whipped cream, use a good quality heavy cream
  and add a pinch of powdered sugar.  Layer the ingredients carefully for a visually
  appealing presentation. '

flavor_description: 'Jamaican Coffee is a delightful fusion of sweet and bold flavors.
  The smooth rum provides a warm, caramel-like base, while the rich coffee adds a
  robust, earthy complexity.  A hint of water balances the sweetness, and the fluffy
  whipped cream adds a touch of airy lightness, culminating in a creamy, decadent
  finish. '
