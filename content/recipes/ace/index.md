title: "The Ace Cocktail"
fullname: "The Ace Cocktail"
shortname: "Ace"
description: "The Ace is a delightful twist on the classic Clover Club, a gin-based cocktail that emerged in the late 19th century. It's a member of the Sour family, known for its tangy and creamy character, but the Ace adds a touch of sweetness and richness with the grenadine and heavy cream. "
flavor_description: "The Ace is a creamy, sweet, and slightly tart cocktail with a surprising depth of flavor. The gin provides a crisp, juniper-forward base, balanced by the sweet, floral notes of grenadine. The heavy cream and milk add a smooth, velvety texture, while the egg white contributes a subtle, airy foam. The overall taste is reminiscent of a rich, decadent dessert with a hint of citrus. "
bartender_tips: "This sounds like a twist on a classic!  To make a smooth, silky Ace, focus on the egg white.  Dry shake it first (without ice) to create a frothy texture, then add ice for a proper shake.  The grenadine should be a *splash* to add color and sweetness, not overwhelm the gin.  Heavy cream and milk balance the richness.  Lastly, a beautiful garnish, like a cherry or orange zest, elevates the presentation. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing the Ace Cocktail:**Imagine a cocktail called Ace made with Gin, Grenadine, Heavy Cream, Milk, and Egg White. Describe its appearance in detail, focusing on its color, texture, and any visual elements that stand out.****Consider these questions:*** What is the overall color of the cocktail? Is it a single color, or does it have layers?* What is the texture like? Is it creamy, frothy, or have any distinct layers?* Are there any visual elements that stand out, such as a garnish, foam, or swirls?* How does the light interact with the cocktail? Does it reflect or refract in any interesting ways?**Example Output:**The Ace presents a captivating sight. Its base is a vibrant, almost-fluorescent pink, courtesy of the grenadine. A thick layer of velvety white foam, created by the egg white, sits atop this vibrant base.  The light dances on the surface, casting shimmering reflections that evoke a sense of playful whimsy.  A delicate garnish of a cherry perched on the edge adds a touch of classic elegance, rounding out the visual experience. "
