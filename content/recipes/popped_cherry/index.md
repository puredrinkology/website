description: "The Popped Cherry belongs to the Sour family, a classic cocktail group characterized by a balance of sweet, sour, and spirit.  While its exact origin is unknown, it likely evolved from the popular Cranberry Sour with the addition of cherry liqueur for a vibrant, fruity twist. "
flavor_description: "The Popped Cherry is a delightful, bright cocktail that hits all the right notes.  The vodka provides a clean, smooth base, while the cherry liqueur adds a sweet and fruity depth.  Cranberry juice brings a tart and tangy element, balanced by the sweetness of orange juice.  Expect a refreshing, well-rounded cocktail with a pleasant lingering sweetness and a subtle tartness. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfectly balanced Popped Cherry, use high-quality vodka and a cherry liqueur with strong cherry flavor.  Freshly squeezed orange juice is key, so use it sparingly.  Shake well with ice to ensure a smooth, chilled consistency.  Don't over-dilute with cranberry juice â€“ a little goes a long way.  Finish with a maraschino cherry for a festive touch. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Imagine a Popped Cherry cocktail. It's made with vodka, cherry liqueur, cranberry juice, and orange juice. Describe its appearance in detail, focusing on the colors, clarity, and any potential garnishes.****Example Output:**The Popped Cherry is a vibrant and alluring cocktail. It's a deep ruby red hue, almost like a polished cherry, with subtle hints of orange peeking through. The liquid itself is crystal clear, with no cloudiness or sediment. A single, plump maraschino cherry sits on the rim of the glass, its bright red contrasting beautifully with the dark red drink. Optionally, a thin orange twist might be added for a touch of citrusy elegance, its green stem peeking out above the rim. The overall effect is a playful and festive cocktail, perfect for any celebration. "
