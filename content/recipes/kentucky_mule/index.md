description: "The Kentucky Mule is a twist on the classic Moscow Mule, belonging to the **Mule family**.  This bourbon-based variation likely originated in the American South, combining the refreshing ginger and lime notes of the Mule with the robust flavor of Kentucky bourbon. "
flavor_description: "The Kentucky Mule is a spicy and refreshing cocktail. The sweetness of the ginger syrup balances the robust notes of bourbon, while the lime juice adds a bright acidity. The soda provides a light and bubbly texture, making it a perfect drink for warm weather or after a long day. The overall flavor profile is bold and complex, with a delightful kick from the ginger. "
bartender_tips: "When making a Kentucky Mule, fresh is best! Squeeze your limes right before mixing.  A good ginger syrup is key â€“ homemade is ideal, but a quality bottled option will do.  Don't over-shake, as it'll make the drink too frothy.  Use a copper mug if you have one, it chills faster and enhances the flavors. Finally, top with a splash of soda, not a full pour, for a lighter and more refreshing finish. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Imagine a Kentucky Mule cocktail. It's a refreshing mix of ginger syrup, bourbon, lime juice, and soda. Describe its appearance in detail. Consider:*** **Color:** What shades of yellow, amber, or brown are present? How does the ice affect the color?* **Clarity:** Is it crystal clear, slightly cloudy, or heavily frosted with ice?* **Texture:** How does the soda's fizz interact with the other ingredients? What about the ice?* **Garnish:** What kind of garnish might be used? How does it affect the overall presentation?* **Glassware:** What type of glass is it served in? How does the glass shape enhance its appearance? **Example:**The Kentucky Mule gleams in a copper mug, its amber hue tinged with a subtle green from the lime juice. The ice cubes, frosted and melting, create a cloudy halo around the drink. A delicate layer of foam crowns the surface, a testament to the bubbly soda. A sprig of fresh mint, nestled on the rim, adds a verdant touch and a tantalizing aroma to the already inviting scene. "
