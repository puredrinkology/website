author: "Pure Drinkology"
description: "The Oaxacan Old Fashioned is a modern twist on the classic Old Fashioned, drawing inspiration from the rich history of mezcal in Oaxaca, Mexico.  It's a riff on the classic, adding smoky mezcal to the traditional sugar, bitters, and spirit base, creating a complex and nuanced flavor profile. "
flavor_description: "This Oaxacan Old Fashioned is a complex and smoky cocktail. The Demerara Gum Syrup adds a rich, caramel sweetness, while the tequila provides a bright, vegetal backbone. The smoky notes of the mezcal come through beautifully, enhanced by the subtle, bitter chocolate notes of the bitters. The result is a truly unique and memorable drink that is both sweet and savory, with a lingering warmth. "
bartender_tips: "For a balanced Oaxacan Old Fashioned, use a good quality, smoky Mezcal and a high-proof Tequila.  Dissolve the Demerara Gum Syrup in a little hot water to create a smooth syrup.  Don't over-muddle the orange peel, just a light squeeze to release oils.  Use a large ice cube for slow dilution and a rocks glass to retain the smoky aroma.  Finish with a dash of chocolate bitters and a flamed orange peel for a dramatic touch. "
