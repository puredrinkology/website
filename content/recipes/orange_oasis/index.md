fullname: "The Orange Oasis Cocktail"
shortname: "Orange Oasis"
description: "Orange Oasis is a refreshing Highball, a cocktail family known for its tall, mixed-drink format. This bubbly concoction likely originated in the early 20th century, drawing inspiration from the popularity of fruit-forward cocktails and the widespread use of ginger ale as a mixer. "
flavor_description: "The Orange Oasis is a delightful blend of sweet and tart. The cherry brandy contributes a rich, fruity sweetness that's balanced by the citrusy tang of orange juice. Gin adds a subtle herbal note, while ginger ale provides a refreshing fizz. This cocktail is light, easy to drink, and perfect for a warm day. "
bartender_tips: "For a vibrant Orange Oasis, chill your glass and ingredients beforehand.  Use a good quality cherry brandy for depth and a premium gin for balance.  Shake the cherry brandy, gin, and orange juice with ice to ensure proper dilution.  Top with chilled ginger ale for a refreshing fizz.  Garnish with a fresh orange slice and a maraschino cherry. "
