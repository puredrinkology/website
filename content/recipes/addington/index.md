fullname: "The Addington Cocktail"
shortname: "Addington"
description: "The Addington belongs to the **Vermouth Cocktail** family, a classic style featuring vermouth as the base spirit. Though its exact origin is murky, it likely arose in the early 20th century as a dry, refreshing alternative to the more complex vermouth cocktails of the Victorian era. "
flavor_description: "The Addington is a delicate dance of bittersweet flavors. The sweet vermouth brings notes of caramel and spice, while the dry vermouth contributes a herbal dryness and subtle bitterness. The soda water adds a refreshing effervescence and lightness, creating a balanced and subtly complex cocktail that's both approachable and intriguing. "
bartender_tips: "The Addington is a delicate balance of sweet and dry.  Chill your vermouths thoroughly before mixing.  Use a good quality soda water for a crisp finish.  Don't over-ice, let the vermouths shine.  A subtle touch of orange bitters can add complexity.  Serve in a chilled coupe for an elegant presentation. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:Imagine a tall, elegant glass filled with a beautiful blend of colors. The base is a deep, amber hue, reminiscent of aged oak, from the sweet vermouth. It's layered with a paler, straw-like shade of the dry vermouth, creating a subtle gradient. Finally, the soda water adds a light, effervescent touch, creating delicate bubbles that rise to the surface, resembling tiny, shimmering stars. The overall effect is a harmonious symphony of colors, hinting at the complex and refreshing flavors waiting to be enjoyed. **Bonus:** Can you also describe the *texture* of the drink, focusing on how the soda water interacts with the vermouths?
