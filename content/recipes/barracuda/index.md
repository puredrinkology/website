description: "The Barracuda is a vibrant, tropical concoction that belongs to the **Rum Punch** family. It likely originated in the Caribbean, where rum, pineapple, and lime are staples, with the addition of Galliano adding a distinct Italian flair.  "
flavor_description: "The Barracuda is a vibrant and tropical cocktail. The rum provides a warm, spicy base, while the Galliano adds a sweet, herbal complexity. Pineapple juice contributes a juicy sweetness, balanced by the tartness of lime juice. The Prosecco adds a refreshing effervescence and a touch of dryness, making for a delightful and well-rounded experience. "
bartender_tips: "Shake the rum, Galliano, pineapple and lime juices with ice. Strain into a chilled coupe glass. Top with Prosecco and garnish with a lime wheel. Use a high-quality white rum and fresh juices for the best flavor.  Don't overshake - you want a light, frothy head on your drink.  And lastly,  enjoy the tropical sunshine in a glass! "
