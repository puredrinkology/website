fullname: "The 50/50 Cocktail"
shortname: "50/50"
description: "The 50/50 is a classic example of a **highball**, a family of mixed drinks typically served in tall glasses with a base spirit and a mixer. Its origins likely lie in the early 20th century, where the popularity of citrus-based cocktails like the Screwdriver and Orange Blossom blossomed. "
flavor_description: "The 50/50 is a harmonious blend of sweet and citrusy notes. The vanilla vodka provides a creamy, comforting base, while Grand Marnier adds a rich orange liqueur complexity. Fresh orange juice balances the sweetness with a bright, tangy zest. The result is a smooth, refreshing cocktail that's both sophisticated and easy to drink. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality vanilla vodka for a richer flavor. Ensure the Grand Marnier is chilled for a crisp, refreshing finish.  Shake the cocktail hard with ice to create a smooth, velvety texture. If you prefer a sweeter drink, add a splash of simple syrup. Garnish with an orange peel for an aromatic touch. "
