bartender_tips: 'This cocktail is a sweet, creamy delight.  For best results, use
  quality Scotch and high-quality half-and-half. Chill all ingredients beforehand
  for a smoother consistency.  Shake vigorously with ice to thoroughly combine all
  flavors.  Strain into a chilled cocktail glass and garnish with a chocolate curl
  or a sprinkle of cocoa powder. '

description: 'This drink, a creamy concoction, is not a traditional cocktail but rather
  a modern, indulgent creation.  It draws inspiration from the creamy liqueurs of
  the early 20th century, but its specific combination of flavors and ingredients
  is likely a recent invention. '

flavor_description: 'This cocktail is a decadent, creamy indulgence. The Scotch provides
  a smoky, peaty foundation, while the half-and-half adds a smooth richness. Condensed
  milk contributes sweetness and a velvety texture. Coconut syrup brings a touch of
  tropical sweetness, while chocolate syrup adds depth and complexity. The flavors
  harmonize beautifully, creating a luxurious and satisfying experience. '
