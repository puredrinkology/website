bartender_tips: 'Ensure the orgeat syrup is fresh and high quality - it''s the backbone
  of the cocktail.  Use a good Irish whiskey, and don''t skimp on the St. George Pear
  Liqueur - it adds complexity.  Shake vigorously with ice to chill and dilute properly.  Top
  with club soda for a light, refreshing finish.  Garnish with a lemon twist and a
  pear slice for a touch of elegance. '

description: 'Dublin Heights is a refreshing twist on the classic Sour family. Its
  Irish Whiskey base, balanced by tart lemon and sweet orgeat, is elevated by the
  pear notes of St. George Liqueur.  The addition of club soda creates a light, effervescent
  finish, reminiscent of a summer day in Dublin. '

flavor_description: 'The Dublin Heights is a delightful blend of sweet and tart.  The
  orgeat syrup provides a nutty, almond-like sweetness that''s balanced by the bright
  acidity of lemon juice.  The Irish whiskey adds a warm, spicy complexity, while
  the pear liqueur contributes a delicate fruitiness.  A refreshing fizz from the
  club soda rounds out the experience, making it a truly enjoyable and well-balanced
  cocktail. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of a cocktail called Dublin Heights
  using the following ingredients:*** **Orgeat:** A viscous, slightly cloudy liquid
  with a pale yellow-amber hue, reminiscent of honey.* **Irish Whiskey:** A golden
  amber liquid, often with a slightly reddish tint, displaying a smooth, elegant clarity.*
  **Lemon Juice:** A clear, bright yellow liquid, sometimes tinged with a subtle green
  shade.* **St. George Pear Liqueur:** A translucent, light golden liquid with a delicate
  pear-like sheen.* **Club Soda:** A clear, bubbly liquid that appears like a refreshing,
  sparkling water.**Consider these aspects in your description:*** **Color:** What
  is the overall color of the cocktail? Is it vibrant or muted?* **Clarity:** Is the
  cocktail clear, cloudy, or layered?* **Texture:** Does the cocktail appear smooth,
  frothy, or layered with different consistencies?* **Garnish:** Imagine a sprig of
  fresh mint and a thin slice of pear as garnish. How do they contribute to the visual
  appeal? **Example:**The Dublin Heights appears as a shimmering amber elixir, its
  golden depths reflecting the pear liqueur''s subtle shimmer. A delicate froth, the
  result of the club soda, crowns the drink, hinting at its refreshing nature. A sprig
  of fresh mint and a pear slice, their vibrant green and yellow hues adding a touch
  of vibrancy, complete the cocktail''s alluring appearance. '
