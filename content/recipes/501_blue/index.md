description: "The 501 Blue is a vibrant member of the Sour family, a category known for its tart and refreshing nature.  While its exact origin is unknown, its combination of sweet and tart flavors suggests a likely American invention, born from the desire for a colorful and exciting drink. "
flavor_description: "The 501 Blue is a refreshingly sweet and tart cocktail with a vibrant blue hue. The Blue Curacao delivers a citrusy sweetness, balanced by the tartness of the sour mix. Blueberry Schnapps adds a juicy blueberry flavor, while the vodka provides a clean, smooth base. The 7-Up adds a bubbly, effervescent touch and mellows the sweetness. Overall, it's a light and fruity cocktail perfect for warm weather. "
bartender_tips: "When crafting a 501 Blue, prioritize layering for visual appeal. Pour the Blue Curacao first, followed by the Blueberry Schnapps for a vibrant gradient. Gently add the vodka and sour mix, then top with 7-Up.  A light shake with ice before pouring will ensure a chilled and balanced drink. Garnish with a blueberry for an extra touch. "
