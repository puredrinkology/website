visual: "## LLM Prompt for Vermouth Cassis Description:**Imagine a tall, elegant glass filled with a beautiful ombre effect. The bottom third is a deep, rich crimson hue, like a ruby held up to the light. This vibrant color gradually fades upwards, blending into a pale, straw-like yellow, reminiscent of the golden sunset.
