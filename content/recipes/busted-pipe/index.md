#### The Busted Pipe Chronicles
Now, while we might not have a detailed history book entry for the Busted Pipe, we do know it's a concoction that speaks to the soul of anyone who appreciates a good, strong drink. Think of it as a modern-day potion, crafted by those who believe in the art of cocktail-making.

#### Your Busted Pipe Ingredients
- **Bourbon**: 1.5 oz - The foundation, providing that rich, caramel flavor.
- **Amaro Nonino**: 1.5 oz - This Italian liqueur brings in herbal and slightly bitter notes.
- **Orange Bitters**: 2 dashes - Adds a subtle citrusy twist.
- **Cocoa Bitters**: 2 dashes - For that unexpected, delightful depth.

#### Crafting the Perfect Busted Pipe
1. **Stir, Don't Shake**: In a mixing glass, combine your bourbon, Amaro Nonino, and both types of bitters with ice. Stir until well chilled and properly diluted.

2. **Serve**: Strain into a rocks glass over a large ice cube or a few smaller ones. 

3. **Presentation**: No garnish needed here; this drink speaks for itself. But if you must, a simple twist of orange peel will do.

#### Tips for Serving
- **Ice Matters**: Use the best ice you've got. Clear, large ice cubes are ideal for slower dilution.
- **Glassware**: A rocks glass, also known as an old-fashioned glass, is perfect. It shows off the drink's color and simplicity.
