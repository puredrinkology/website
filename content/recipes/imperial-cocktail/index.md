  boozy. To ensure a perfect pour: * Use freshly squeezed lime juice for optimal flavor.*
  Chill your gin and Aperol beforehand to maintain a cool, refreshing drink. * Shake
  vigorously with ice to thoroughly chill and blend the ingredients.* Strain into

description: 'The Imperial Cocktail, a refreshing blend of lime juice, gin, and Aperol,
  belongs to the **Gin Sour family**. Its origins are debated, but likely emerged
  in the **1920s**, during the American Prohibition era, as a twist on the classic
  Gin Sour. '
family: sour
flavor_description: 'The Imperial Cocktail is a refreshing and bittersweet delight.
  The gin provides a crisp, juniper-forward base, while the Aperol brings a vibrant
  orange bitterness and a touch of sweetness. The lime juice adds a bright acidity
  that cuts through the sweetness and balances the overall flavor profile. The result
  is a complex and well-rounded cocktail that''s both invigorating and approachable. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of an Imperial Cocktail, taking into
  consideration the following ingredients:*** **Lime Juice:**  Consider the pale,
  slightly cloudy hue and the potential for a thin rim of foam. * **Gin:**  Consider
  the clear, colorless nature of most gins, noting any potential for a slight shimmer.
  * **Aperol:**  Focus on the vibrant orange hue and the slight opacity, almost like
  a light marmalade. **In your description, consider:*** **The color of the drink:**
  Is it a single, uniform hue, or do layers of color emerge? * **The texture:** Is
  it clear and smooth, or does it have a slight haze or a touch of foam? * **The overall
  impression:**  Is the drink elegant and refined, or vibrant and playful? **Please
  write your description in a way that is both informative and evocative.** '
