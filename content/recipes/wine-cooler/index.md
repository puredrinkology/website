bartender_tips: 'For a refreshing Wine Cooler, use a good quality dry red wine, like
  a Pinot Noir or Beaujolais.  Chill the wine and soda beforehand.  Fill a tall glass
  with ice, add the wine, top with soda, and gently stir.  Don''t over-stir, as you
  want to keep the bubbles lively.  A lemon wedge garnish adds a nice touch. '

flavor_description: 'The Wine Cooler is a refreshing, light, and slightly tart cocktail.
  The red wine provides a subtle fruitiness and tannins, while the lemon-lime soda
  adds a bubbly sweetness and citrus acidity. The ice chills the drink and dilutes
  the wine''s intensity, making it a perfect summer sipper. '
