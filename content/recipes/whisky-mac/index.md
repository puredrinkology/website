bartender_tips: 'The Whisky Mac is a simple yet classic drink, but there are a few
  tricks to make it shine. Use a good quality Scotch with some age for depth. Opt
  for a sweet, fortified wine like ruby port or sweet vermouth.  Chill both ingredients
  beforehand for a refreshing experience.  Shake vigorously with ice to dilute and
  chill the drink, then strain into a chilled coupe glass. Garnish with a twist of
  orange peel for a touch of citrus aroma. '

visual: '## LLM Prompt:**Imagine a Whisky Mac, a classic cocktail made with Scotch
  whisky and sweet vermouth. Describe the drink''s appearance in vivid detail. Consider:***
  **Color:** Is it a deep amber, a reddish hue, or something in between?* **Clarity:**
  Is it clear, or does it have a slight cloudiness?* **Texture:** Is it smooth and
  silky, or does it have a slight oily sheen?* **Ice:** What type of ice is used,
  and how does it affect the drink''s appearance?* **Garnish:** What, if any, garnish
  is used, and how does it contribute to the overall aesthetic?**Example:** The Whisky
  Mac, a captivating blend of amber Scotch and ruby vermouth, boasts a deep, rich
  hue reminiscent of polished mahogany. Its clarity is pristine, with a subtle, almost
  imperceptible shimmer from the ice.  A large, clear ice cube sits nestled within
  the chilled glass, melting slowly and releasing a gentle mist.  A twist of orange
  peel rests elegantly on the rim, offering a fragrant aroma that complements the
  complex notes of the drink. '
