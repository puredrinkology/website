description: "The Orange Whip is a delightful twist on the classic cream-based cocktail family, likely drawing inspiration from the creamy concoctions popularized in the early 20th century. Its exact origin remains shrouded, but it likely emerged from the creative bartending scene, a testament to the enduring appeal of blending tropical fruit flavors with creamy textures. "
flavor_description: "The Orange Whip is a delightful blend of sweet and tart, with a creamy smoothness. The orange juice provides a vibrant citrus punch, while the rum and vodka contribute a subtle, warm spice. The cream adds a luxurious richness, balancing the acidity and creating a velvety texture.  The ice chills the cocktail, making it refreshing and perfect for a hot day. "
bartender_tips: "For a smooth Orange Whip, use a high-quality rum and vodka.  Ensure the cream is chilled for a thick consistency.  Shake vigorously with ice to thoroughly chill and blend the flavors.  Strain into a chilled coupe glass for a sophisticated presentation. A subtle orange zest garnish adds a fragrant touch. "
