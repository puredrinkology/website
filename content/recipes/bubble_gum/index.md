description: "The Bubble Gum cocktail, with its fruity blend of vodka, banana liqueur, orange juice, and peach schnapps, falls into the **Fruity Cocktail** family. Its origin is unknown, likely a modern concoction born from the popularity of sweet, playful drinks. "
flavor_description: "Bubble Gum is a playful, fruity cocktail with a playful sweetness.  The banana liqueur gives it a creamy, tropical base, while the orange juice adds a bright citrus punch.  Peach Schnapps brings a delicate floral sweetness, with the vodka providing a smooth, clean finish. It's a light and refreshing drink, perfect for a sunny afternoon or a fun night out. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfectly balanced Bubble Gum, use a good quality vodka and a banana liqueur that's not too sweet.  Freshly squeezed orange juice is key, but don't overdo it.  Start with a small amount of peach schnapps and adjust to taste.  Shake with ice until chilled and strain into a chilled glass. A rim of sugar or orange zest adds a nice touch. "
