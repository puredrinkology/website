bartender_tips: 'For a smooth, silky egg nog, temper your eggs gently.  Whisk yolks
  with sugar and salt until pale, then slowly drizzle in hot milk, whisking constantly
  to prevent curdling.  Simmer until thickened, stirring frequently. Cool completely
  before adding vanilla and chilling.  Don''t overcook; it''ll become grainy.  Use
  fresh, high-quality ingredients for the best flavor! '

description: 'Egg-nog, a classic cooked beverage, belongs to the **Creamy Cocktail**
  family.  Originating in England during the 17th century, it was traditionally a
  winter drink enjoyed by the upper classes.  The name egg-nog is thought to derive
  from the noggin, a wooden cup used to serve the drink. '

flavor_description: 'This classic eggnog is a creamy, comforting delight.  The sweetness
  of the sugar is balanced by the subtle saltiness, while the rich vanilla extract
  adds warm notes.  The egg yolk adds a velvety texture and depth of flavor, creating
  a luxuriously smooth mouthfeel.  It''s a classic for a reason, delivering a comforting
  warmth and festive spirit with every sip. '
