fullname: "The Bramble Cocktail"
shortname: "Bramble"
description: "The Bramble is a classic sour, a family of cocktails featuring a spirit, citrus juice, and sweetener.  Born in 1984 at the The Harp pub in London, it's credited to Dick Bradsell, who wanted a simple, yet elegant drink featuring creme de mure (blackberry liqueur). "
flavor_description: "The Bramble is a delightful marriage of tart and sweet. Gin's juniper notes dance with zesty lemon, balanced by a touch of sweetness from the sugar syrup. Creme de Mure adds a luscious blackberry complexity, creating a deep, fruity depth that lingers on the palate. This cocktail is a true gem, showcasing both the boldness of gin and the subtle elegance of blackberry liqueur. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Bramble, use good quality gin and a fresh lemon.  Muddle the sugar syrup and lemon juice thoroughly to release the citrus oils.  Don't over-shake - you want the creme de mure to swirl beautifully.  A good garnish is a blackberry on a skewer, or a lemon twist.  And, of course, a chilled glass is essential! "
