bartender_tips: 'This is a fiery combo!  Use high-quality whiskey for a smoother burn.  Chill
  the Hot Damn beforehand for a refreshing contrast.  Shake hard with ice to dilute
  slightly and create a frothy top.  Rim the glass with chili powder or cinnamon sugar
  for a spicy kick.  Garnish with a lime wedge for a bright touch.  '
