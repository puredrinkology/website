description: "The Michelada, a Mexican spin on a classic chelada, is a member of the **beer cocktail** family.  Its origin is debated, but it's widely believed to have emerged in Mexico in the early 20th century, blending the refreshing tang of tomato juice with the boldness of beer. "
flavor_description: "The Michelada is a savory and tangy cocktail with a kick. The beer provides a light malt base, while the tomato juice adds a rich, umami depth. Lime juice balances the sweetness with a bright acidity, while hot sauce delivers a fiery heat. Worcestershire and soy sauce contribute savory notes, creating a complex and satisfying flavor profile. "
bartender_tips: "Use a good quality lager for the Michelada.  Chill all ingredients, especially the beer.  Start with a small amount of hot sauce and adjust to your desired spice level.  A pinch of salt enhances the flavor.  Mix the tomato juice, lime juice, hot sauce, Worcestershire, and soy sauce in a separate glass before adding to the beer.  Serve with a lime wedge and a pinch of chili powder for garnish. "
