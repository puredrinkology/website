bartender_tips: 'For a balanced Blood Moon,  start by chilling your glass. Use a high-quality
  bourbon and a good blood orange cordial.  Shake hard with ice to ensure proper dilution.  The
  aromatic bitters add complexity, but use sparingly.  A touch of cinnamon garnish
  adds warmth.  Adjust the lemon juice to taste for your preferred level of tartness. '

  orange hue resembling a full moon bathed in the warm glow of sunset. The drink exhibits
  a slight haze, the result of the subtle cloudiness from the blood orange cordial
