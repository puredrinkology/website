title: "410 Gone"
description: "410 Gone falls into the Highball family, a simple yet refreshing category. It's likely a modern creation, combining the classic soda-and-spirit mix with the popularity of fruit-infused vodkas. The name, referencing an area code, suggests a regional or local origin. "
flavor_description: "The 410 Gone is a sweet and refreshing cocktail with a playful balance of flavors. The Peach Vodka provides a smooth, fruity base, while the Coca-Cola adds a classic cola sweetness and a hint of spice. The combination creates a delightful mix of peach, vanilla, and caramel notes, resulting in a satisfyingly sweet and fizzy drink that's perfect for any occasion. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect 410 Gone, chill your Coca-Cola. It helps maintain the fizz and keeps the drink refreshingly cold. Use good quality peach vodka for a more pronounced flavor. Don't over-pour the vodka; a 1:2 ratio with Coca-Cola is ideal. A simple garnish of a peach slice or a maraschino cherry adds a touch of elegance. "
