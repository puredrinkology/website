bartender_tips: "When making a Pegu Club, prioritize fresh lime juice for that bright\
  \ acidity.  Use a good quality gin for the base, and don't skimp on the bitters!\
  \ A few dashes of both Angostura and orange bitters will add complexity and balance\
  \ the sweetness of the Cura\xE7ao.  Shake with ice until well-chilled, and strain\
  \ into a chilled coupe for a classic presentation.  Enjoy! "

flavor_description: "The Pegu Club offers a vibrant and complex taste profile. The\
  \ gin provides a crisp, juniper-forward base, while the orange cura\xE7ao adds a\
  \ sweet, citrusy complexity. Lime juice brings a tart, refreshing acidity, balanced\
  \ by the subtle bitterness of both Angostura and orange bitters. The interplay of\
  \ these flavors creates a refreshing, slightly bitter, and ultimately harmonious\
  \ experience. "
