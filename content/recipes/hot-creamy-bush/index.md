bartender_tips: 'For a smooth, creamy Hot Creamy Bush, start by warming your Irish
  whiskey and coffee gently. Don''t boil! Add Baileys last, stirring gently to avoid
  over-mixing and creating a foamy mess. Garnish with a sprinkle of cinnamon or nutmeg
  for a touch of warmth.  Enjoy! '

visual: '## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of a Hot Creamy Bush cocktail, made
  with Irish whiskey, Baileys Irish Cream, and coffee. Focus on the following aspects:***
  **Color:** What shades dominate the drink? Is it a uniform color or layered? Does
  it have any interesting hues or gradients?* **Texture:** Is it smooth and creamy?
  Are there any visible swirls or layers? * **Presentation:** How is the drink typically
  served? In a glass, mug, or other vessel?  Is there any garnish or additional element
  that adds visual interest?**Example response:**The Hot Creamy Bush presents a rich,
  inviting spectacle. Its core color is a deep, mahogany brown, the result of the
  Irish whiskey and coffee blending.  A layer of velvety, pale ivory Baileys Irish
  Cream crowns the top, adding a contrasting element and creating a subtle, two-toned
  effect. The cream might feature delicate swirls or patterns depending on the mixing
  technique. The cocktail is typically served in a warm, ceramic mug, adding a touch
  of rustic charm and enhancing the warmth of the beverage. A sprinkle of cocoa powder
  or a cinnamon stick garnish can further accentuate the drink''s inviting aroma and
  appearance. '
