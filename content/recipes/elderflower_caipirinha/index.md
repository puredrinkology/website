shortname: "Elderflower Caipirinha"
description: "The Elderflower Caipirinha is a modern twist on the classic Caipirinha, hailing from Brazil.  It belongs to the Sour family, characterized by a base spirit, citrus juice, and a sweetener. The elderflower cordial adds a floral complexity, elevating the traditional rum-based sour. "
flavor_description: "The Elderflower Caipirinha is a delightful dance of sweet and tart. The cachaça's earthy, sugarcane spirit mingles with the bright acidity of lime, creating a vibrant base. Elderflower cordial adds a delicate floral sweetness, balancing the sharpness and bringing an ethereal touch. It's a refreshing, complex cocktail that's both elegant and invigorating. "
bartender_tips: "Muddle the lime aggressively to release the oils, don't be shy!  A good muddle is key to a balanced Caipirinha.  Use a high-quality cachaça for best results.  A little bit of elderflower cordial goes a long way, so start with a small amount and adjust to your liking.  Serve it chilled and garnish with a lime wedge.  Cheers! "

visual: "## LLM Prompt:**Describe the appearance of an Elderflower Caipirinha. Imagine a glass filled with crushed ice, a splash of lime juice, a subtle swirl of elderflower cordial, and a generous pour of Cachaça. Consider the color, clarity, and texture of the drink. Include details like how the ice interacts with the liquid, the appearance of the lime, and any potential garnish.** **Example Response:**The Elderflower Caipirinha is a vibrant and inviting drink. The crushed ice in the glass is a pristine white, its surface barely disturbed by the shimmering liquid. The Cachaça, a clear spirit, forms a base for the drink, its color slightly tinted by the bright, chartreuse green of the elderflower cordial. A wedge of lime, its skin a deep, glossy green, rests on the rim of the glass, releasing its citrusy aroma into the air. The texture is refreshing and lively, with the crushed ice giving way to the smooth, cool liquid. It's a cocktail that captivates both the eyes and the palate. "
