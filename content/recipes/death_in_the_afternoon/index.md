description: "Death in the Afternoon is a classic *liqueur cocktail*, a category that combines spirits with other flavors, often sweet or herbal.  Created by Ernest Hemingway, the drink  combines the anise-flavored absinthe with champagne, reflecting Hemingway's fondness for both. "
flavor_description: "Death in the Afternoon is a complex and intriguing cocktail.  The Absinthe provides a strong, herbal, and slightly anise-flavored base, with notes of licorice and wormwood. The Champagne adds a touch of sweetness and effervescence, creating a delicate balance between the bitter and the sweet. The result is a unique and memorable cocktail that is both refreshing and challenging, reflecting its literary namesake. "
bartender_tips: "**Chill your champagne thoroughly.** Absinthe is already chilled, so you want the champagne to be as cold as possible to keep the drink refreshing.  **Use a high-quality absinthe.**  This is the star of the show!  **Pour the absinthe first, then top with champagne.** This ensures proper layering and preserves the absinthe's aroma. **Garnish with a sugar cube or a lemon twist** for an elegant touch.

visual: "## LLM Prompt: Describe the appearance of a Death in the Afternoon cocktail. **Imagine a tall, slender champagne flute filled with a pale, ethereal liquid. The top layer is a shimmering, almost translucent pale gold, reminiscent of moonlight on water. As you look deeper, the golden hue gradually fades into a deeper, more mysterious green, like a secret hidden beneath the surface.  This green, the color of Absinthe, swirls and dances in the bottom of the glass, creating an alluring contrast with the sparkling champagne above.  Tiny bubbles rise from the depths, shimmering like diamonds in the green, creating a delicate, almost hypnotic effect.  The overall impression is one of elegance and mystery, a captivating mix of lightness and darkness.** **Bonus:*** Describe the visual impact of the cocktail on the table or bar, especially in low-light conditions.* How does the appearance change as the ice melts and the cocktail chills?*  What are the visual effects of the Absinthe and Champagne mixing together?
