bartender_tips: 'When building your Texas Rattlesnake, remember this:* **Layer Carefully:**
  The key is to slowly pour the liquids, ensuring each layer remains distinct. Start
  with the heaviest (Yukon Jack), then Cherry Brandy, Southern Comfort, and finally
  Sweet and Sour. * **Chill Everything:** Pre-chill the glasses for a refreshingly
  cold experience.  * **Use Good Quality:**  Use top-shelf Southern Comfort for the
  best flavor.* **Garnish:** A cherry or orange peel adds a touch of elegance. '

  in the American South, where it gained popularity in the 1970s, reflecting a blend
  of regional favorites like Southern Comfort and cherry brandy. '
