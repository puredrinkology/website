description: "Fig Jam belongs to the Sour family, a classic cocktail style known for its tart and sweet balance. This unique twist on the Sour likely originated in the early 20th century, drawing inspiration from the burgeoning use of fruit liqueurs and the burgeoning American cocktail scene. "
flavor_description: "The Fig Jam is a complex and intriguing cocktail.  The fig syrup brings a sweet, jammy base, balanced by the spicy rye and the bright orange liqueur. A touch of bitter orange adds depth, while the balsamic vinegar creates a savory, almost umami note, rounding out the profile with a surprising twist. The result is a cocktail that is both familiar and unique, with a lingering sweetness and a hint of tartness. "
bartender_tips: "To elevate your Fig Jam, use a high-quality fig syrup with a deep, complex flavor.  Ensure your rye is robust to stand up to the sweetness.  For a smoother finish, opt for a less-bitter orange liqueur.  Don't be shy with the balsamic vinegar; a few drops add a touch of savory depth.  Finally, a good stir ensures proper dilution and a balanced cocktail. "
