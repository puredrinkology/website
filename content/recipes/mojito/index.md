description: "The Mojito belongs to the Highball family, characterized by its tall, chilled presentation and combination of spirits, mixers, and ice.  Originating in Cuba, the Mojito's origins can be traced back to a 16th-century drink called Draque made with sugarcane juice, lime, and mint. "
flavor_description: "The Mojito is a refreshing, balanced cocktail with a vibrant, herbal kick. The light rum provides a subtle sweetness and a touch of warmth, while the lime juice adds a tartness that balances the sugar. Fresh mint leaves infuse the drink with a cool, minty aroma and flavor, and the soda water provides a crisp, bubbly finish.  "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Mojito, muddle the mint gently, don't pulverize it. Use a light touch with the sugar, just enough to dissolve. Add the rum after the soda, as it will sink to the bottom. For a refreshing twist, add a lime wheel to the glass before muddling. Don't forget the ice! "

visual: "##  LLM Prompt for a Mojito Description:Imagine a tall glass filled with crushed ice, the surface glistening with condensation.  The glass is adorned with a vibrant green hue, created by a lush cluster of fresh mint leaves delicately muddled with lime wedges.  A clear, light rum rests beneath, creating a subtle golden shimmer.  The entire concoction is topped with sparkling soda water, forming a hazy, effervescent crown.  A sprig of fresh mint and a slice of lime garnish the rim, adding a final touch of freshness and elegance.  **Describe the Mojito, capturing its refreshing color, vibrant texture, and the interplay of its ingredients.** "
