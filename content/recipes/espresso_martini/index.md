description: "The Espresso Martini, a potent blend of vodka, coffee liqueur (Kahlua), and a touch of sweetness, is a member of the Coffee Cocktail family.  This iconic drink, born in London in the 1980s, is said to have been created by a bartender seeking a cocktail as strong as coffee and as smooth as silk. "
flavor_description: "The Espresso Martini is a bold, decadent cocktail with a rich and creamy texture. It's a complex blend of coffee, chocolate, and vodka. The espresso provides a strong, slightly bitter coffee flavor, while the Kahlua adds a sweet, chocolatey note.  The vodka adds a smooth, slightly spicy kick, and the sugar syrup balances the flavors, creating a harmonious blend. It's a sophisticated and satisfying drink that will leave you wanting more. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Espresso Martini, use freshly brewed espresso, not instant. Shake hard with ice to chill and emulsify the ingredients. A good shake creates a silky smooth texture. Strain into a chilled martini glass for an elegant presentation. Garnish with coffee beans for a touch of sophistication. "

visual: "##  Describe the visual appeal of an Espresso Martini:**Prompt:** Imagine a cocktail glass, chilled and beaded with condensation. Inside, a rich, dark brown liquid rests, the color of freshly brewed coffee.  A thick, velvety layer of creamy foam crowns the drink, creating a smooth, inviting surface.  The foam is the color of light brown sugar, with subtle hints of espresso peeking through.  Perhaps a dusting of cocoa powder adorns the top, adding a touch of visual intrigue.  What else can you see in this drink?  Describe the texture and the way the light reflects off the surface.  What emotions does this image evoke? "
