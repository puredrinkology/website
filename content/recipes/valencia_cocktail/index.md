description: "The Valencia Cocktail is a vibrant, citrus-forward drink belonging to the Sour family. It likely originated in the early 20th century, drawing inspiration from the popular Sidecar, with its base of brandy and citrus. The orange bitters add a subtle, aromatic complexity. "
flavor_description: "The Valencia Cocktail is a delightful blend of sweet and tart.  Apricot brandy brings a rich, fruity sweetness with subtle notes of stone fruit.  Orange juice offers refreshing acidity, while orange bitters add a touch of complexity and a subtle herbal nuance.  The result is a balanced, flavorful cocktail that's perfect for a sunny afternoon or a celebratory toast. "
bartender_tips: "Use a high-quality apricot brandy for the best flavor.  Freshly squeezed orange juice is key, and don't skimp on the bitters â€“ they add complexity. Shake well with ice to chill thoroughly, then strain into a chilled coupe glass. Garnish with an orange twist for a classic touch. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing the Valencia Cocktail:**Imagine a classic cocktail glass, filled to the brim with a vibrant, sunny orange hue. The liquid shimmers with a gentle, almost imperceptible sparkle, hinting at the subtle sweetness of the apricot brandy within. A thin, pale orange peel curls gracefully along the rim, adding a touch of elegance and releasing a fragrant aroma of citrus and spice. The cocktail itself appears incredibly smooth and inviting, with a hint of froth at the top that suggests a delicate sweetness balanced by a subtle bitter note.** **Bonus Prompt:*** **For a more nuanced description, consider the age and quality of the apricot brandy. A younger brandy might have a lighter color, while an older one could have a richer, amber tone.  * **Mention the texture of the ice used.  Is it crushed, cubed, or a combination? How does this influence the overall appearance and mouthfeel?** * **Describe the glass itself. Is it a traditional coupe, a martini glass, or something else entirely?** "
