visual: '## LLM Prompt:Describe the appearance of a Grand Blue cocktail, made with
  Malibu Rum, Peach Schnapps, Blue Curacao, and Sweet & Sour. Consider the following:*
  **Color:** What shades of blue and other colors are present? Is it a solid color,
  or does it have layers or gradients?* **Clarity:** Is it clear, cloudy, or hazy?*
  **Texture:** Is it smooth, bubbly, or does it have any garnishes?* **Overall Impression:**
  How would you describe the visual appeal of the cocktail? Is it vibrant and playful,
  or sophisticated and elegant?**Example Response:** The Grand Blue is a vibrant,
  layered masterpiece. The bottom layer is a rich, golden amber hue from the Malibu
  Rum and Peach Schnapps, topped with a bright, electric blue layer from the Blue
  Curacao. The Sweet & Sour, while contributing to the flavor, doesn''t significantly
  alter the color palette. The cocktail is clear and refreshing, with a gentle effervescence
  that dances in the glass.  The Grand Blue is a captivating drink, offering a visual
  feast before even taking the first sip. '
