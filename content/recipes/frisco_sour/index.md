fullname: "The Frisco Sour Cocktail"
shortname: "Frisco Sour"
description: "The Frisco Sour is a member of the Sour family, a classic cocktail style featuring a base spirit, citrus juice, and sweetener. This specific variation, likely hailing from San Francisco (Frisco), embraces the city's history of blending whiskey and the distinctive herbal sweetness of Benedictine. "
flavor_description: "The Frisco Sour is a vibrant and complex cocktail. The blended whiskey provides a smooth, mellow base, while the Benedictine adds a touch of herbal sweetness with notes of honey and spice. The citrus juices, both lemon and lime, deliver a bright, tart acidity that balances the sweetness. The overall flavor profile is well-rounded, with a harmonious blend of sweetness, spice, and citrus. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Frisco Sour, focus on balance. Use a high-quality blended whiskey with a smooth finish.  Don't skimp on the Benedictine, its herbal notes are crucial.  When juicing the citrus, go for a 2:1 ratio of lemon to lime for a bright, tart flavor. Finally, a light egg white foam adds elegance and texture.  Shake well with ice, strain into a chilled coupe, and garnish with a lemon twist. "
