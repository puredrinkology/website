description: "The Gin Sling is a classic highball, a refreshing and simple cocktail family favored for its tall, chilled form. It's believed to have originated in 18th-century India, where gin was mixed with local ingredients for a thirst-quenching drink. "
flavor_description: "The Gin Sling is a refreshing and bright cocktail. The gin's botanicals shine through with a juniper-forward character, balanced by tart lemon juice and a touch of sweetness from the powdered sugar.  The water adds a light, crisp mouthfeel, while the orange peel offers a subtle citrus aroma. This classic drink is crisp and clean, perfect for a hot day. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Gin Sling, use a good quality gin and freshly squeezed lemon juice.  Dissolve the powdered sugar in the water to make a simple syrup, ensuring it's fully dissolved before adding to the gin and juice.  Gently muddle the orange peel to release its oils before adding it to the cocktail.  Serve over ice in a tall glass, garnished with a twist of orange peel. "
