bartender_tips: "This drink is all about layering, so chill your ingredients beforehand\
  \ for the best visual effect.  Pour the J\xE4germeister slowly down the side of\
  \ the glass, followed by the Sambuca (it'll float), and top with vodka for a clean\
  \ finish.  Don't stir \u2013 you want distinct layers!  Use a shot glass for a traditional\
  \ presentation or a rocks glass for a larger serving. "

flavor_description: "The Freddy Kruger is a bold, assertive cocktail.  The J\xE4germeister\
  \ brings its signature herbal and spiced notes, while the Sambuca contributes a\
  \ sweet, licorice-forward flavor. Vodka serves as a clean canvas, allowing the other\
  \ flavors to shine. Expect a complex mix of bitter, sweet, and licorice, with a\
  \ slightly warming finish. It's not for the faint of heart, but for those who enjoy\
  \ adventurous flavor combinations. "
