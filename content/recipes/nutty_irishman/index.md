shortname: "Nutty Irishman"
description: "The Nutty Irishman, a creamy blend of Baileys Irish Cream, Frangelico, and milk, falls into the **creamy cocktail family**. It's likely a modern invention, combining popular Irish and Italian liqueurs for a rich, nutty, and decadent treat. "
flavor_description: "The Nutty Irishman is a creamy, decadent treat with a balanced sweetness.  The Baileys provides a smooth, rich Irish cream base, while the Frangelico adds a distinct hazelnut and vanilla note.  A touch of milk mellows the sweetness and adds a velvety texture, creating a comforting and luxurious experience.  Think of a warm, nutty hug in a glass. "
bartender_tips: "Chill your glass and ingredients beforehand for a super smooth, refreshing drink. Use high-quality Irish Cream and Frangelico for the best flavor. Shake vigorously with ice to ensure proper emulsification and a creamy texture.  Don't over-shake, as you want the drink to be thick, not watery. Garnish with a chocolate shavings or a sprinkle of cinnamon for an extra touch of indulgence. "
