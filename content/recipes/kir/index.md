description: "The Kir, a simple yet elegant cocktail, is a member of the aperitif family, enjoyed before meals to stimulate the appetite.  Originating in Burgundy, France, it was named after Félix Kir, a French priest and mayor who promoted the use of Crème de Cassis with local wine. "
flavor_description: "The Kir is a harmonious blend of sweet and tart. The **Crème de Cassis**, a blackcurrant liqueur, delivers a rich, fruity sweetness with a subtle, almost jammy intensity. This sweetness is then balanced by the delicate, sparkling acidity of the **Champagne**, creating a refreshing and elegant cocktail. The final taste is a complex interplay of sweet berry, citrus, and bubbly notes, leaving a clean and lingering finish. "
bartender_tips: "For a perfect Kir, chill both the Creme de Cassis and Champagne beforehand.  A splash of Cassis is key – use a 1:10 ratio of Cassis to Champagne. Gently pour the Cassis into the chilled Champagne flute, then top with the Champagne.  Avoid stirring, as this can diminish the bubbly.  Garnish with a blackcurrant or a lemon twist for an elegant touch. "

visual: "## LLM Prompt for Describing a Kir Cocktail:**Imagine a tall, slender champagne flute filled to the brim with a delicate, pale pink liquid. The base of the flute holds a vibrant, almost opaque layer of deep, ruby red Creme de Cassis, which gradually transitions into a soft, blushing pink as it meets the champagne. The bubbles of the Champagne rise through the liquid, creating a gentle effervescence that dances with the light. The overall effect is one of refined elegance, a beautiful balance of richness and lightness. ** **Bonus:**  Include sensory details to enhance the description. For example: * **Aroma:** The cocktail releases a delicate scent of blackcurrant and a subtle hint of the champagne's yeasty notes. * **Texture:** The bubbly texture of the champagne contrasts with the smooth, syrupy richness of the Creme de Cassis, creating a unique mouthfeel.
