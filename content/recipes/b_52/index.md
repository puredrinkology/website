title: "B-52"
description: "The B-52 is a layered shot, a classic cocktail family known for its visually striking appearance.  Originating in the 1970s, likely in the United States, this cocktail gets its name from the B-52 bomber aircraft, with its layered colors representing the plane's markings. "
flavor_description: "The B-52 is a layered delight, beginning with the sweet, creamy, and subtly chocolatey notes of Baileys.  The middle layer, Grand Marnier, brings in a bright, orangey sweetness with hints of floral and citrus. The final layer of Kahlua provides a rich, coffee-infused base with a touch of bitterness, rounding out the experience with a lingering, complex flavor. "
bartender_tips: "The key is layering, so use a shot glass or a small cocktail glass. Pour Kahlua first, then Grand Marnier carefully down the back of a spoon, and finally Baileys on top. The layers should be distinct. Don't stir, just light the Baileys on fire with a long match or lighter, let it burn for a few seconds, then extinguish it before drinking.  Enjoy! "
