bartender_tips: '**Muddle mint leaves gently** with ginger syrup and lemon juice,
  don''t crush them. This releases the mint''s aroma without bitterness. **Use a good
  quality bourbon**, as it''s the star of the show. **Don''t over-shake** the cocktail,
  as it will dilute the flavors. **Top with a splash of club soda** just before serving,
  keeping the fizz alive. **Garnish with a fresh mint sprig** for a beautiful and
  fragrant finish. '

flavor_description: 'The King Smash Mule is a complex and refreshing cocktail. The
  ginger syrup provides a spicy kick, while the bourbon adds warmth and a touch of
  sweetness.  Lemon juice brings a bright acidity that balances the flavors, and the
  mint leaves offer a cool, herbaceous note.  Expect a smooth, well-rounded experience
  that''s both invigorating and satisfying. '
