        <p>
        The term Fizz was popularized in the 19th century, with one of the earliest noted fizzes being the Gin Fizz, first appearing in print around 1887. The Silver Fizz, Golden Fizz, and Royal Fizz soon followed, each adding its twist to the basic formula.

        <p>
        Prohibition Era: Fizz cocktails saw a surge in popularity during Prohibition due to their ability to mask the taste of inferior spirits with effervescence and citrus.

        <p>
            Typically, gin is the spirit of choice, but variations exist with other spirits like whiskey or vodka.<br/><br/>
            Citrus: Fresh lemon or lime juice is essential, bringing the essential sour component.<br/>
            Sweetener: Often simple syrup or sugar, balancing the drink's acidity.<br/>
            Carbonation: Soda water or seltzer adds the signature fizz, providing both bubbles and dilution.<br/>
            Foam: Egg White interacts with the sweetener and citrus to create a meringue foamy head, creating a richer taste and finish.<br/>
