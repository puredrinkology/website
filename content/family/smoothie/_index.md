        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>History of the Smoothie</h2>
        <p>
        The history of smoothies dates back to the early 20th century, with roots in health-conscious trends and the growing popularity of fruit-based drinks. In the 1920s and 1930s, the first blender was introduced, allowing for easier mixing of fruits and liquids, and leading to the creation of the early versions of smoothies. However, the concept of a smoothie as we know it today began to take shape in the 1960s and 1970s, alongside the health food movement, particularly in California.

        <p>
        The rise of health food and natural juice bars in the 1970s, especially in cities like Los Angeles, played a significant role in the popularization of smoothies. These drinks were marketed as nutritious alternatives to sugary sodas, often featuring fruits, vegetables, and yogurt. In the 1990s, the introduction of smoothie chains like Jamba Juice helped make smoothies a mainstream beverage option, offering a wide variety of blends that catered to different tastes and dietary preferences.

        Today, smoothies are enjoyed globally, with countless variations using ingredients like protein powders, superfoods, dairy or non-dairy alternatives, and an array of fruits and vegetables, making them both a healthy snack and a convenient meal option.
