        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>History of the Tea</h2>
        <p>
        The history of tea dates back over 5,000 years to ancient China, where it is believed to have been discovered by Emperor Shen Nong in 2737 BCE. Legend says that tea was accidentally created when tea leaves blew into a pot of boiling water. Initially used for medicinal purposes, tea became a popular beverage in China by the Tang Dynasty (618–907 CE). Tea culture spread to Japan, Korea, and other parts of Asia, where it became central to daily life and spiritual practices, especially in Japan’s tea ceremonies.

        By the 16th century, tea was introduced to Europe by Portuguese and Dutch traders. It quickly became a symbol of wealth and sophistication, particularly in Britain, where the tradition of afternoon tea began in the early 19th century. As European colonial empires expanded, tea plants were cultivated in colonies like India and Sri Lanka, making tea more accessible to the masses. Today, tea is one of the most consumed beverages globally, enjoyed in countless varieties and styles across cultures.
