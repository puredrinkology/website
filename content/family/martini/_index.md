        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>How to make a Martini</h2>
        <p>
        Let's start with the patriarch: the Classic Martini.
        </p>
        <p>
        Born from the simplicity of gin and dry vermouth, garnished with an olive or a twist of lemon, this drink epitomizes minimalism in mixology. 
        </p>
        <p>
        Over time, variations have been developed, replacing the gin with vodka - which was shaken not stirred by James Bond.
