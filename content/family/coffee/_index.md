        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>History of the Coffee</h2>
        <p>
        The history of coffee drinks dates back to the 15th century when coffee was first brewed in Yemen. The beverage quickly spread across the Arabian Peninsula and reached Europe by the 17th century, where coffeehouses became popular social hubs. The earliest coffee drinks were simple brews, but over time, regional preferences and innovations led to a variety of coffee preparations. The espresso, invented in Italy in the early 1900s, revolutionized coffee-making by introducing high-pressure brewing methods.

        <p>
        From espresso, drinks like the latte, cappuccino, and macchiato emerged. In the 1990s, Starbucks popularized more complex coffee drinks globally, introducing flavored lattes, frappuccinos, and iced coffees, shaping the modern coffee culture we know today.
