        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>History of The Highball Cocktail</h2>
        <p>
        Highballs trace their origins back to the late 19th century, with the term itself coined around the same time. The word 'highball' likely comes from the railroad signal for 'full speed ahead', suggesting an unobstructed path, much like the straightforwardness of these drinks. They gained popularity during the Prohibition era as an easy way to disguise bootleg liquor with mixers like soda or ginger ale.

        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>How to make a Highball Cocktail</h2>
        <p>
        Any spirit can serve as the base, from whiskey in a Whiskey Highball to vodka in a Screwdriver.<br/>
        Mixer - Typically, this is a carbonated beverage like soda water, cola, ginger ale, or tonic water, which adds effervescence and often a slight sweetness or bitterness.<br/>
        Ice - Essential for dilution and temperature, enhancing the drink's refreshment factor.  <br/>

Welcome to the Highball family, where the cocktail's essence is distilled into its purest form - simplicity, refreshment, and versatility. 

A highball is fundamentally a cocktail comprising a base liquor and a larger amount of a non-alcoholic mixer, traditionally served over ice in a tall glass. This straightforward formula has made highballs beloved for their ease of preparation and refreshing nature.

Highballs have become cultural icons in different parts of the world. In Japan, the Mizuwari (whiskey with water) and the Highball (whiskey with soda) have become staples, with bars specializing in the art of perfecting this simple drink. In the West, highballs like the Gin and Tonic or Rum and Coke are perpetual favorites.

Today, highballs continue to evolve. Craft sodas, exotic tonics, and artisanal mixers offer new flavor profiles, yet the core remains unchanged: simplicity married with refreshment. From classic to contemporary, highballs are a testament to the enduring appeal of less being more in the world of cocktails.
