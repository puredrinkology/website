        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>History of the Punch Cocktail Family</h2>
        <p>
        The punch cocktail family can trace its roots back to the 17th century, originating in India as 'paantsch', a word from Hindi meaning 'five', which referred to the five original ingredients: spirit, sugar, lemon, water, and tea or spices. British sailors and traders brought this concoction back to England, where it evolved into a communal drink served at social gatherings.

        During Prohibition, punches provided a way to serve alcohol discreetly, often with fruit juices or sodas to mask the taste of inferior spirits.

         Generally, a punch includes a base spirit, a sweetener, citrus or tart component, water or a non-alcoholic mixer, and often a spice or aromatic element. Modern punches might also include fruit or vegetable juices, tea, or wine.
