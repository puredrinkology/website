        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>History of the Hot Chocolate</h2>
        <p>
        Hot chocolate has a rich history dating back to the ancient Maya and Aztec civilizations in Mesoamerica around 2,000 years ago. They created a bitter, spiced drink from ground cocoa beans, mixed with water and chili peppers, called xocoatl.
        </p>
        <p>
         The beverage was often reserved for royalty and religious ceremonies. When Spanish explorers brought cocoa to Europe in the 16th century, it was sweetened with sugar and became a popular drink among the elite. By the 17th century, hot chocolate spread across Europe, where it evolved into the sweeter, creamier version we enjoy today. Over time, it became accessible to all, transforming into a comforting, global favorite for cold days.
