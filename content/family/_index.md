        <p>
        The Sour family introduces balance with citrus, like in a Margarita, adding tartness to the sweetness and strength, creating a harmonious blend that's refreshing and complex.

        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>Highballs and Fizz</h2>
        The Highball simplifies further, mixing a spirit with a larger portion of a non-alcoholic mixer, like soda in a Gin and Tonic, for a lighter, effervescent drink. 

        Fizz cocktails add a twist with the inclusion of egg or cream, introducing texture and a frothy top, while maintaining the highball's carbonation.

recipe: "Each family builds on the last, either by simplifying or complicating the recipe, altering the balance of flavors, or changing the presentation, illustrating the evolution of cocktail culture from straightforward spirit-focused drinks to complex, layered concoctions."

Cocktail families are like branches of a tree, each with unique characteristics yet interconnected through common roots in mixology. 

#### Ancestral's
Starting with the Ancestral (or Old Fashioned) family, these cocktails are simplicity at its finest, focusing on spirit, sugar, water, and bitters, setting a foundation for all cocktails. 

#### Spirit Forward, Negroni's, and Martini's
From this base, the Spirit-Forward family, including the Martini, evolves by emphasizing the spirit with minimal adulteration, often just vermouth, showcasing the liquor's purity.
