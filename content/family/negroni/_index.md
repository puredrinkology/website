        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>History</h2>
        <p>
        Legend has it that in the early 20th century, a certain Count Camillo Negroni, while sipping his usual Americano (Campari, vermouth, and soda) at Caffè Casoni in Florence, decided he wanted something stronger. He asked the bartender to swap the soda for gin.

        <p>
        Thus, the Negroni was born, not with a whisper, but with a shout.
        </p>
        <p>
        From Italian aperitivo culture to global cocktail menus, the Negroni has transcended borders, becoming a symbol of sophistication and boldness.

        <h2 class='fs-4 text-primary py-3'>How it's made</h2>
        <p>
        The Negroni is essentially made up of equal parts gin, campari, and sweet vermouth, garnished with an orange peel.  
        Variations exist by replacing the gin with another base spirit such as a whiskey, prosecco, or even cachaca. You can play around with the bitterness by replacing the campari with another amaro, and also playing with the type of vermouth.
