        <p>
        The history of crème-based cocktails, like many cocktail origins, is steeped in tradition and innovation, with roots tracing back to the early 20th century. These cocktails, characterized by their creamy texture often derived from cream, ice cream, or egg whites, have evolved from simple after-dinner drinks into sophisticated mixology creations.

        The Alexander, a quintessential crème cocktail, was first documented around 1915 by Hugo Ensslin in his book 'Recipes for Mixed Drinks'. Initially made with gin, crème de cacao, and cream, it was named possibly after a character from an advertising campaign or a bartender, reflecting the cocktail's tie to cultural and social events of the time. Its evolution into the Brandy Alexander, substituting gin with brandy, showcases how these drinks adapted to popular tastes and ingredients available during Prohibition and beyond.

        Crème-based cocktails were not just about taste but also about presentation and texture. The inclusion of cream or egg whites wasn't merely for flavor; it was for creating a luxurious mouthfeel and a visually appealing drink. This era also saw the use of crème liqueurs like crème de violette in cocktails like the Aviation, highlighting the versatility of crème ingredients in mixology.
